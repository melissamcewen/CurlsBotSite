# Low porosity results page
Want to make a new results page for my quiz
Quiz is in src/app/porosity-quiz
Current results pages are in /porosity/[type]


We are only changing the low porosity page for now
we don't need reusable components right now, just focus on getting it up, we'll refactor later


Use Daisy UI 5 components like cards
Just use placeholder images for now
Goal is to get people to signup for email AND click on affilate links

- Hero: visual float left on desktop, on top on mobile
- Email signup: field float left on desktop, with button inline, field on top on mobile
- Comparison: two columns on both desktop and mobile
- Product, show small image on left 1/3rd width on both desktop and mobile, text area with buy button
- For Rough or Coarse Hair similar to comparison
- For more hold: Product

Eventually need to implement
- Link to full guide (with canonical switch)
- Localization
## Hero

[Visual of intact cuticle]

Low porosity hair has a smooth cuticle and an oily F-layer that blocks water and products from entering. That’s why **light** products work best — heavy oils and butters tend to just sit on top and can make hair look greasy and stringy. Heat can help products like deep conditioners penetrate the hair.
