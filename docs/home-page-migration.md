# Home Page Revamp

Context: CurlsBot was originally a hackathon project and only had the CGM analyzer, so it made sense for the CGM analyzer to be on the home page. Now that we have less of a focus on CGM, I'd like to move the CGM analyzer elsewhere and have the homepage be a hub that explains the site and directs users to things they are interested in.

## Design Prompts

### Homepage

- goal: make it easy to see what the site does at a glance for new visitors while making it more accessible
- Our main CGM tool the analyzer is moving elsewhere, and I'm reducing our emphasis/promotion of CGM so I want it to be easy to get to but not a focus
- Maybe first card (or something like a mini hero, but I don't want to use real daisyui hero element because it takes up too much space) a one sentence intro, a friendly image (use placeholders), then in small text a link like "go to the analyzer" but don't make it a button
- Second would be learn about your hair, with a short 1 sentence CTA, button to hair type quiz
- Third would be Curly Girl Method, buttons link to analyzer and cgm hub
- Forth would be porosity, say what it is and link to quiz and analyzer
- then idk if this would be a card or a section, we could copy the relaeted blog post design src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx to show a selection of blog posts
- no images in the cards (except the top hero-ish thing), but use icons

### CGM Hub

**Design Prompt: CGM Hub for Curlsbot.com**

Create a visually appealing and user-friendly information hub for the Curly Girl Method (CGM) using a card-based UI. The goal is to give users a simple overview of CGM and guide them to more detailed resources. The target audience is people new to CGMâ€”especially those seeking beginner-friendly info.

**Visual Style**: Clean, approachable, modern, mobile-friendly. Use soft, natural colors and curly hair-inspired visuals (waves, spirals). Include simple illustrations or icons for visual interest.

**Cards:**

1. **Intro to CGM**

   - Content: Brief explanation of CGM, created by Lorraine Massey and introduced in her book.
   - CTA: Button tMo full CGM guide.
   - Optional: Small image of the book or illustration of curly hair.

2. **Ingredient Rules**

   - Content: Quick list of what to avoid:

     - No sulfates (in shampoos)
     - No silicones
     - No waxes
     - Avoid drying alcohols

   - CTA: Button linking to full ingredient cheatsheet.
   - Optional: Icons representing each ingredient type (e.g., bottle with X).

3. **Curlsbot CGM Analyzer**

   - Content: Description of the analyzer tool. "Paste in an ingredient list and instantly check if the product is CGM-friendly."
   - CTA: Button linking to the analyzer.
   - Optional: Graphic showing an input box or example scan.
