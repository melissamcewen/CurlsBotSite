          "notes": "Humectants grab water out of air, but if air doesn't have enough water (dry weather), it can become brittle and create friction, which can mean frizz. Theoretically this could dehydrate hair. Oils can slow water loss. Notes that glycerin can be paired with emollients and film-formers to slow water loss. Caveats that none of this is well studied."

          "notes": "Defines film forming humectants as complex molecules that lose water more slowly because they have more 'nooks and crannies' for the water to hang out in. Also notes that hydrolyzed proteins can be film forming humectants. Smaller proteins can get under the cuticle and 'moisturize' from the inside. Medium/large proteins can form films. Pairing with oils can also help slow water loss."
