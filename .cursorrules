haircare-ingredients-analyzer is a library I made, there might be issues with it

this app uses a flat rounded design style so no shadows or sharp edges

use types from the haircare-ingredient-analyzer library when working with it

avoid async/await in tests when using haircare-ingredients-analyzer since it's a synchronous local library - this prevents unnecessary complexity and race conditions in tests
