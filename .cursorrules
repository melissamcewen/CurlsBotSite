haircare-ingredients-analyzer is a library I made, there might be issues with it

this app uses a flat rounded design style so no shadows or sharp edges, also no opacity, just use solid colors from the daisy ui palette

use solid heroicons V2 for icons, from the heroicons library @heroicons/react/solid

tests go in the tests/src library

tests should mainly be smoke tests, we're just trying to make sure nothing is broken. Don't focus on specific text in tests.

use types from the haircare-ingredient-analyzer library when working with it


get ingredient data directly from haircare-ingredients-analyzer using getBundledDatabase() - do not create separate data files for ingredients

the docs for the haircare-ingredients-analyzer library are in docs/haircareanalyzer.md


the analysis results statuses correspond to the following daisy ui colors:
- caution, warning
- warning, error
- ok, info
