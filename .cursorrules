haircare-ingredients-analyzer is a library I made, there might be issues with it

this app uses a flat rounded design style so no shadows or sharp edges, also no opacity, just use solid colors from the daisy ui palette

use lucide icons

tests go in the tests/src library

tests should mainly be smoke tests, we're just trying to make sure nothing is broken. Don't focus on specific text in tests.

use types from the haircare-ingredient-analyzer library when working with it

get ingredient data directly from haircare-ingredients-analyzer using getBundledDatabase() - do not create separate data files for ingredients

the docs for the haircare-ingredients-analyzer library are in docs/haircareanalyzer.md

the analysis results statuses correspond to the following daisy ui colors:
- caution, warning
- warning, error
- ok, info

DO NOT ADD FEATURES I DID NOT EXPLICITLY ASK FOR

We're using Next 15 NOT 13
