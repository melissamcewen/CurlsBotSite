Some people say it is just your hair \"getting used to it,\" but I don't think so. I think a lot of is caused by using products that are too heavy for your hair. If your hair is any of the following:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Fine</li>\n        <li>Wavy</li>\n        <li>Low porosity</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>You may need lighter products. Think about last time you spilled oil on clothing. Hard to get out right? When you use oily products you're doing the same thing to your hair.\n    </p>\n\n     <p>Some common <em>oily</em> product lines include:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Shea Moisture (with some exceptions listed below)</li>\n        <li>Cantu</li>\n        <li>Carol's Daughter</li>\n        <li>Adding plain oil to your hair</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>Using lighter products will help your hair curl or wave better, and prevent it from looking greasy.</p>\n\n      <p>Some people (like me!) also have naturally oily skin, which means that oily products just contribute to the problem. Removing them and adding in a sulfate-free cleanser (often called a low-poo) can make a huge difference.</p>\n\n      <p>Another way to lighten up your routine is limit your styling products to 1-2 products. Lighter products are mostly gels and mousses rather than creams and leave ins. My own routine is:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Low poo</li>\n        <li>Conditioner</li>\n        <li>Either two stylers: Styler: curl enhancer and Styler: hold</li>\n        <li>OR just one Styler with both curl enhancement and hold</li>\n      </ul>\n\n        <Card body>\n            <CardTitle>Could Hard Water Make Buildup Worse?</CardTitle>\n           <CardText>Another thing to consider is hard water.

Most commonly\n   * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n   * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n   *\n   * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n   * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the components.\n   * It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For example we can\n   * add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n   *\n   * ```jsx\n   * import Transition from 'react-transition-group/Transition';\n   *\n   * const duration = 300;\n   *\n   * const defaultStyle = {\n   *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n   *   opacity: 0,\n   * }\n   *\n   * const transitionStyles = {\n   *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\n   *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n   * };\n   *\n   * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n   *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n   *     {(state) => (\n   *       <div style={{\n   *         ...defaultStyle,\n   *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n   *       }}>\n   *         I'm A fade Transition!\n   *       </div>\n   *     )}\n   *   </Transition>\n   * );\n   * ```\n   *\n   * As noted the `Transition` component doesn't _do_ anything by itself to its child component.\n   * What it does do is track transition states over time so you can update the\n   * component (such as by adding styles or classes) when it changes states.\n   *\n   * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n   *  - `ENTERING`\n   *  - `ENTERED`\n   *  - `EXITING`\n   *  - `EXITED`\n   *\n   * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component begins the\n   * \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from its current transition state,\n   * to `'entering'` for the duration of the transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once\n   * it's complete.

Curlsbot lists these cleansers as \"caution.\" It's up to you to decide whether they are right for your hair or not.

</h1>\n    <p>Many people want to follow the  <ReactGA.OutboundLink eventLabel=\"https://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-Girl-Method-for-Curly-Hair\" to=\"https://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-Girl-Method-for-Curly-Hair\" target=\"_blank\">curly hair method </ReactGA.OutboundLink> but do not want to give up dying their hair. Most hair dyes contain harsh ingredients that may damage hair. In addition, many contain silicones that can deposit on your hair. Luckily there are several good options:</p>\n    <h2>Pure Henna (and other herbal dyes)</h2>\n    <p>Henna and other herbal dyes (indigo, cassia) are completely curl friendly. They also do not do any damage to the hair. The disadvantage is it can be hard to predict the results, there is a learning curve for using them, and the color options are more limited.</p>\n\n    <p>That said, I have personally switched to henna and love it. I use an \"auburn\" mix that doesn't look too far off from my natural color. It leaves my hair shiny and healthy and I only need to dye every 4-6 months. Some people report that their curls are altered by henna, but I haven't found this to be the case.</p>\n    <p>Some curl specific henna tips</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Check your ingredients! Most henna on the market is adulterated with harsh ingredients. Purchase from a reputable pure henna brand like <ReactGA.OutboundLink eventLabel=\"http://www.ancientsunrise.com/default.asp0\" to=\"http://www.ancientsunrise.com/default.asp\" target=\"_blank\">Ancient Sunrise</ReactGA.OutboundLink>.</li>\n      <li>Always clarify before doing henna with a low-poo like  <ReactGA.OutboundLink eventLabel=\"http://amzn.to/2kLT3H0\" to=\"http://amzn.to/2kLT3H0\" target=\"_blank\">Kinky Curly Come Clean</ReactGA.OutboundLink>. If you do not do this, the dye may not work. In addition if you have hard water you may want to do a special treatment to remove the stains hard water can leave. For that like Ion Hard Water Shampoo or  <ReactGA.OutboundLink eventLabel=\"http://www.mehandi.com/product-p/rain_01.htm\" to=\"http://www.mehandi.com/product-p/rain_01.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Rainwash</ReactGA.OutboundLink></li>\n      <li>Consider using protein-free products if you use henna since it essentially also acts as a protein treatment. </li>\n      <li>Do your research! <ReactGA.OutboundLink eventLabel=\"https://www.ancientsunrise.blog/henna-hair-book/\" to=\"https://www.ancientsunrise.blog/henna-hair-book/\" target=\"_blank\">Ancient Sunrise has a great online book you should read before trying henna.</ReactGA.OutboundLink>.</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <h2>Chemical Dyes</h2>\n    <p>All chemical dyes contain para-phenylenediamine which damage the hair. If you chose this, you can mitigate the damage by chosing the right products for caring for your hair afterwards.</p>\n\n     <h3>Silicone Free Dyes</h3>\n     <p>I used <ReactGA.OutboundLink eventLabel=\"http://amzn.to/2CqupQc\" to=\"http://amzn.to/2CqupQc\" target=\"_blank\">Herbatint</ReactGA.OutboundLink> and <ReactGA.OutboundLink eventLabel=\"http://amzn.to/2CVSXla\" to=\"http://amzn.to/2CVSXla\" target=\"_blank\">Naturtint</ReactGA.OutboundLink> before switching to Henna and it does not contain silicones.</p>\n\n    <p>If your hair dye contains silicones and you don't want to switch away, you can clarify with a silicone-removing shampoo like <ReactGA.OutboundLink eventLabel=\"http://amzn.to/2kLT3H0\" to=\"http://amzn.to/2kLT3H0\" target=\"_blank\">Kinky Curly Come Clean</ReactGA.OutboundLink> after dying.</p>\n\n    <h3>Repair options after chemical dyes</h3>\n    <p>Many curly folks swear by <a href=\"https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/ingredients/olaplex-according-to-the-hair-pros\">Olaplex</a> for restoring the hair after chemical dyes. Also para-phenylenediamine makes the hair more high porosity so you may want to switch to higher porosity products.</p>\n\n\n  </div>\n)\n\nexport default dyePage\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/pages/dye.js","import React from 'react'\nimport Link from 'gatsby-link'\nimport Helmet from 'react-helmet'\nimport ReactGA from 'react-ga'\n\n\nconst hardWater = () => (\n  <div>\n    <Helmet\n      title=\"Hard Water + Curly Hair\"\n      meta={[\n        { name: 'description', content: 'Your oily scalp on curly hair might be caused by hard water' },\n        { name: 'keywords', content: 'products, hard water, buildup curly hair' },\n        {\n          property: 'og:image',\n          content: 'http://www.curlsbot.com/img/icon.png'\n        }\n      ]}\n    />\n    <h1>Hard Water + Curly Hair </h1>\n    <p>If you're <ReactGA.OutboundLink eventLabel=\"https://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-Girl-Method-for-Curly-Hair\" to=\"https://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-Girl-Method-for-Curly-Hair\" target=\"_blank\">following a curly hair method  </ReactGA.OutboundLink> and are frustrated with buildup even after switching to <Link to=\"cg-lite\">lighter products</Link>, you may have hard water. </p>\n\n    <h2>What is hard water?</h2>\n    <p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_water\">Hard water</a> has high mineral content. You know you have hard water if you get white buildup on things like faucets or tea kettles. Or you get lots of soap scum in the tub or shower that's hard to scrub off. <a href=\"http://homewater101.com/articles/hard-water-across-us\">Check out this map of the USA, most states seem to have pretty hard water</a> If you're in doubt, <ReactGA.OutboundLink eventLabel=\"http://amzn.to/2CufGmr\" to=\"http://amzn.to/2CufGmr\" target=\"_blank\">you can order hard water test strips.</ReactGA.OutboundLink> </p>\n    <p>On your hair it can combine with your natural oils from your scalp and hair products to form an oily soap scum like film on your hair. Even sulfate shampoo can have trouble breaking this up.</p>\n\n    <h2>My hard water story</h2>\n    <p>So I went on vacation with some new product samples from Moptop and Jessicurl and they worked amazing! But when I got home, they suddenly turned my hair into a limp mess. I could feel gross oily areas near my roots.</p>\n    <p>I didn't know what to do, I tried sulfate shampoo and the oily spots persisted. Someone pointed out that since the thing that changed was the location, it might be the water. I did a hard water treatment and my curls bounced right back!  </p>\n\n    <h2>My routine</h2>\n    <h3>Acidic clarifying treatment </h3>\n    <p>There is a lot of mixed messages online about the best way to remove the deposits. I did try sulfates, it did not work. I got the best results from an acidic treatment. I used the  <ReactGA.OutboundLink eventLabel=\"http://amzn.to/2HrewMd\" to=\"ttp://amzn.to/2HrewMd\" target=\"_blank\">Malibu C Demineralizer treatment.</ReactGA.OutboundLink> This can be a bit harsh so I only use it once a month. Some people also use Ion Crystal Clarifying Treatment (available at Sally's), vinegar, or other <a href=\"http://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2016/03/hard-water-and-your-hair.html\">DIY conconctions.</a></p>\n    <h3>Hard water shampoo</h3>\n    <p>I try to wash my hair as little as possible to limit the need for clarifying. When I do wash, I use a sulfate-free hard-water shampoo called  <ReactGA.OutboundLink eventLabel=\"http://amzn.to/2FaYdCp\" to=\"http://amzn.to/2FaYdCp\" target=\"_blank\">Malibu Hard Water</ReactGA.OutboundLink> (you can get Ion Hard Water at Sally's which is a cheaper dupe). It contains an ingredient (EDTA) that claims to reduce the ability of minerals to buildup. </p>\n\n    <h3>Avoid Roots</h3>\n    <p>I avoid getting styling products and conditioner at the roots as much as possible.</p>\n\n    <h3>Avoid buildup-causing products</h3>\n    <p>I had to ditch any cleansers with anything that could cause buildup. They are the worst problem because you use them directly on your scalp. Avoid cleansers with oils, guar gum, and polyquats. For me one of the worst culpruits it seems was my Broo Thickening Shampoo, I suspect the gums mixed with the hard water to produce a residue. </p>\n\n    <h2>Other options</h2> \n    <h3>Shower filter</h3>\n    <p>Shower filters do not soften water completely, but do remove some of the minerals. <ReactGA.OutboundLink eventLabel=\"http://amzn.to/2CwM9bJ\" to=\"http://amzn.to/2CwM9bJ\" target=\"_blank\">AquaBliss High Output Universal Shower Filter with Replaceable Multi-Stage Filter Cartridge </ReactGA.OutboundLink> is a popular choice. </p>\n    <h3>Water softener</h3>\n      <p>These tend to be more expensive. You can install a whole-house one but the simplest one is the  <ReactGA.OutboundLink eventLabel=\"https://watersticks.com/\" to=\"https://watersticks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ShowerStick </ReactGA.OutboundLink> which is about $200.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  </div>\n)\n\nexport default hardWater\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/pages/hard-water.js","import React from 'react'\nimport Link from 'gatsby-link'\nimport Helmet from 'react-helmet'\nimport ReactGA from 'react-ga'\n\nimport alcohols from '../ingredient-data/alcohols';\nimport silicones from '../ingredient-data/silicones';\nimport waxes from '../ingredient-data/waxes';\n\nimport ResultListing from '../components/analyzer/resultlisting';\n\n\nconst Works = () => (\n  <div>\n    <Helmet\n      title=\"How Curlsbot Works\"\n      meta={[\n        { name: 'description', content: 'How Curlsbot works' },\n        { name: 'keywords', content: 'products, curly hair' },\n        {\n          property: 'og:image',\n          content: 'http://www.curlsbot.com/img/icon.png'\n        }\n      ]}\n    />\n    <h1>How Curlsbot Works/FAQ</h1>\n\n    <h2>1. How do I send Curlsbot lists of ingredients?</h2>\n    <p>Curlsbot used to be a Chatbot on FB but now it is here on this site. Put your ingredients in the box <Link to=\"/\" >here</Link> and get instant results.</p>\n\n    <h2>2. What list do you use?</h2>\n    <p><Link to=\"/curly-girl-ingredient-list/\" >Click here to see our complete list.</Link></p>\n\n    <h2>3. Why does Curlsbot give me the wrong results?</h2>\n    <p>Curlsbot is not perfect, Curlsbot will give the wrong results if ingredients are misspelled. I recommend you find a list from the manufacturer's or a store website rather than typing the list out yourself. Occasionally these lists also have misspellings. <a href=\"http://m.me/curlsbot\">Message me if you see something wrong so I can fix it.</a> </p>\n\n     <h2>4. Why can't Curlsbot read my list?</h2>\n      <p>Curlsbot can only read comma seperated lists like \"ingredient 1, ingredient 2, ingredient 3.\" It cannot read lists like \"ingredient 1/ingredient 2/ ingredient 3\" or those seperated by line breaks. There are some tools online that can fix the list for you or you can do it yourself. </p>\n\n      <h2>5. Can you tell me if this picture is curly hair approved?</h2>\n      <p>Curlsbot cannot read pictures. If you send them to me I also cannot read them because it's not accurate to just have one person look at a bottle and often the picture is blurry. I recommend you find a list from the manufacturer's or a store website OR post the picture on one of the curly hair groups listed in our <Link to=\"/resources/\" >resources page.</Link></p>\n\n      <h2>6. What does it mean if it says \"Caution\"?</h2>\n      <p>We recommend you do your own research since many experts disagree on some ingredients. You can find helpful advice on many curly hair groups listed on our <Link to=\"/resources/\" >resources page.</Link></p>\n\n      <h2>7.Can Curlsbot read other languages besides English?</h2>\n\n      <p>Curlsbot currently only supports English language lists. We recommend finding a group for your language online and posting your product there. I have listed some groups on the <Link to=\"/resources/\" >resources page.</Link></p>\n\n\n\n  </div>\n)\n\nexport default Works\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/pages/howitworks.js","import React from 'react';\nimport ResultListing from '../components/analyzer/resultlisting';\nimport ProductListing from '../components/analyzer/productlisting';\nimport Results from '../components/analyzer/results';\nimport Verdict from '../components/analyzer/verdict';\n\nimport Link from 'gatsby-link'\nimport Helmet from 'react-helmet'\n\nimport ReactGA from 'react-ga';\n\n\nimport { Button, Form, FormGroup, Label, Input, FormText, Card, CardTitle, CardText, CardSubtitle, Alert} from 'reactstrap';\n// ingredients analysis includes\n\nimport analyze from '../ingredients/analyze';\nimport detector from '../ingredients/detector';\nimport cleaner from '../ingredients/cleaner';\n\n\n\nclass Index extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      value: '',\n      result: analyze(''),\n      invalidInput: false,\n      verdict: '',\n      done: false,\n      email: '',\n      subscribeStatus: ''\n    };\n\n    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);\n    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);\n    this.handleEmailChange = this.handleEmailChange.bind(this);\n    this.handleSubscribe = this.handleSubscribe.bind(this);\n  }\n\n  handleEmailChange(event) {\n    this.setState({ email: event.target.value });\n  }\n\n  handleSubscribe(event) {\n    event.preventDefault();\n    const form = document.createElement('form');\n    form.setAttribute('action', 'https://twitter.us14.list-manage.com/subscribe/post');\n    form.setAttribute('method', 'POST');\n    form.setAttribute('target', '_blank');\n\n    // Add hidden fields\n    const userInput = document.createElement('input');\n    userInput.setAttribute('type', 'hidden');\n    userInput.setAttribute('name', 'u');\n    userInput.setAttribute('value', 'dbc1f6ce69d9c1d849eaa642e');\n    form.appendChild(userInput);\n\n    const idInput = document.createElement('input');\n    idInput.setAttribute('type', 'hidden');\n    idInput.setAttribute('name', 'id');\n    idInput.setAttribute('value', 'cd0a9d8b8e');\n    form.appendChild(idInput);\n\n    // Add email input\n    const emailInput = document.createElement('input');\n    emailInput.setAttribute('type', 'email');\n    emailInput.setAttribute('name', 'EMAIL');\n    emailInput.setAttribute('value', this.state.email);\n    form.appendChild(emailInput);\n\n    document.body.appendChild(form);\n    form.submit();\n    document.body.removeChild(form);\n\n    this.setState({\n      email: '',\n      subscribeStatus: 'Thanks for subscribing!

It can be much more harsh than sulfates in <a href=\"http://www.essentialingredients.com/pdf/clariantmildsurfactants.pdf\">all scientific tests of harshness that I have seen</a>. It is also alkaline. The pH of hair is 5.5 and most good quality cleansers are around that as well. But soap is usually 8 or more. This can <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/swiftcraftymonkey/photos/a.1872648986308817.1073741829.1841354482771601/2108742819366098/?type=3\">damage hair badly, leaving it dull and dry</a>. For skin soap can be fine, as skin can recover from the damage. But hair is not \"alive\" and cannot.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"http://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2016/03/hard-water-and-your-hair.html\">If you have hard water, soap can leave residue on your hair that's difficult to remove. </a> Most soaps also contain heavy waxes and oils that leave even more buildup.</p>\n    <p>Some people recommend using baking soda to remove this residue which does <a href=\"https://abetterwaytothrive.com/what-years-of-baking-soda-no-poo-did-to-my-long-healthy-hair-or-when-a-natural-living-experiment-fails/\">further damage to your hair.</a></p>\n    <p>Initially this type of routine may make your hair look nice. But over time buildup and damage take their toll.</p>\n    <p>Curl friendly  <Link to=\"/cleansers\">cleansers</Link> are <a href=\"https://www.quirkyscience.com/difference-soap-detergent/\">detergents, which are different from soap.</a></p>\n    <h2>Are Shampoo Bars Soap?</h2>\n    <p>Shampoo bars are growing in popularity. Many are touted as being environmentally friendly, natural, and budget friendly. But not all shampoo bars are made alike. </p>\n    <p>\n      There are two main types of shampoo bars: those made with <em>soap<em/> and those that contain <em>detergents</em>. Remember these are different!</em>\n    </p>\n    <p>I messaged Lorraine Massey about shampoo bars: she said that she believes they are just as damaging as traditional shampoo. There are a few out there made with gentler detergents (sodium cocoyl isethionate for example) that may be curl-friendly. I recommend always asking the manufacturer to confirm they are ph balanced and <strong>not made with soap</strong> since labeling can be deceptive.</p>\n    <p>Here is a post with <a href=\"https://swiftcraftymonkey.blog/questions-and-answers-about-shampoo-bars-the-master-list/\"> details about soap and pH testing.</a></p>\n    <h2>How do I know if it's soap?(and why Curlsbot fails)</h2>\n    <p>Curlsbot can detect some shampoo bars but not all based on the ingredients lists. Curlsbot only works if contains certain words in the in the ingredients list:</p>\n\n    <ul>\n        <ResultListing list={others.soaps.sort()}/>\n    </ul>\n\n    <p>but not all soap ingredients lists have these ingredients. For example this list would show up OK on Curlsbot</p>\n    <blockquote className=\"blockquote\">\n    ingredients: extra virgin olive oil, *avocado oil, castor oil, *coconut oil, pumpkinseed oil, *fair trade shea butter, purified water, sodium hydroxide, *sweet orange (citrus sinesis) essential oil, lime (citrus aurantifolia) essential oil, infused herbs: *marshmallow root, *catnip, *chamomile, * lavender\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>Even though it's soap! Why? The oils here have been saponified, turning them into soap.</p>\n    <p>Also occasionally Curlsbot might mark an OK ingredient as soap if it's a byproduct of the saponification process.
