    <p>A lot of people are interested in properly caring for their naturally curly or wavy hair, but it can be confusing to find the right methods and products. CurlsBot aims to make it all easier by analyzing ingredient lists to see if they contain ingredients that people with curly hair often avoid. </p>


    <p>This was inspired by my own work on bots at my job as a developer as well as the <a href="http://isitcg.herokuapp.com/">isitcg app</a>. It differs a little in its functionality – it can't tell you about things like protein or humetants yet, but it has a more advanced function for identifying non-"curly girl" ingredients. <a href="https://github.com/melissamcewen/CurlsBotSite">Check out the code here!</a></p>
