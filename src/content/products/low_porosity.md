# Understanding Low Porosity Hair

Low porosity hair has a tightly bound cuticle layer, making it difficult for moisture and products to penetrate the hair shaft. This type of hair requires specific product choices and application techniques to achieve optimal results.

## Characteristics of Low Porosity Hair

- Takes a long time to get wet and dry
- Products tend to sit on top of hair rather than absorb
- Resistant to chemical processes
- Prone to product buildup
- Often appears shiny when healthy

## Product Tips

When choosing products for low porosity hair, look for:

1. **Lightweight formulations** that won't sit heavily on the hair
2. **Humectants** like glycerin and honey that help attract moisture
3. **Emollients** like argan oil and jojoba oil that can penetrate the hair shaft
4. **Clarifying ingredients** to remove buildup

## Application Techniques

- Apply products to damp (not soaking wet) hair
- Use heat or steam to help products penetrate
- Layer products from lightest to heaviest
- Avoid heavy oils and butters that can cause buildup
- Deep condition with heat for better penetration
