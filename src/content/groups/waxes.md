# Waxes

Waxes are primarily used in hair products to provide texture and hold. Unfortunately, they form a thick non-breathable barrier on the hair that can be very difficult to remove.

The barrier it creates can trap moisture and heat, promoting fungal (Malassezia) growth that's linked to conditions like seborraic dematitis.

If you do choose to use waxes, you'll need to use a strong shampoo and I'd also recommend a scalp brush.

The exception is water-soluble waxes, which should wash away easily.

## Are waxes bad for curls

Lorraine Massey's [Curly Girl: The Handbook](https://amzn.to/40b2Jfr)  has a section written by Vida Vladirm that mentions the negative effects of wax

> Traditionally, we multicultural women have used products that contain petroleum, silicone, waxes, and dry oils, believing that they will control, protect, and hydrate their hair. But rather than being absorbed and providing moisture, these products sit on the hair’s surface, repelling water like a duck’s feathers and attracting dirt. No wonder our hair looks dull and lifeless!
