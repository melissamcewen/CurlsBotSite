Low porosity hair has a tightly bound cuticle layer, making it difficult for moisture to penetrate the hair shaft. This type of hair is often resistant to treatments and can be prone to product buildup.

## Characteristics
    Takes a long time to get wet and dry
    Products tend to sit on top of hair rather than absorb
    Resistant to chemical processes
    Prone to product buildup
    Often appears shiny when healthy

## Care tips

    Use heat or steam to help products penetrate
    Focus on lightweight, easily absorbed products
    Regular clarifying treatments to remove buildup
    Apply products to damp hair to improve absorption
    May better tolerate sulfates than other porosity types and even benefit from them
