The Shea Moisture Journey
------------------------

Shea Moisture has been a significant brand in the curly hair community, known for their use of natural ingredients and commitment to textured hair care. However, two major topics dominate discussions about the brand: the 2017 Unilever acquisition and product suitability for different hair types.

The Unilever Acquisition
-----------------------

In 2017, Unilever acquired Sundial Brands, Shea Moisture's parent company, for an estimated $1.6 billion. This acquisition sparked significant discussion in the curly hair community:

### Community Concerns

* **Formula Changes**: Many long-time users report changes in product formulations
* **Quality Consistency**: Some products seem to vary batch-to-batch
* **Corporate Influence**: Concerns about maintaining the brand's original mission
* **Accessibility vs. Authenticity**: While distribution has increased, some feel the brand has lost its roots

### Brand Response

Shea Moisture has maintained that they:
* Continue to use quality natural ingredients
* Remain committed to their core community
* Have improved product availability
* Maintain their ethical sourcing practices

Product Weight and Hair Types
---------------------------

A common topic in curly hair forums is product weight, particularly for those with [low porosity hair](/porosity/low-porosity):

### Why Weight Matters

Heavy products can:
* Weigh down curls
* Cause buildup
* Make hair appear greasy
* Reduce volume
* Increase the need for clarifying

### Shea Moisture's Formulations

Most Shea Moisture products contain:
* Heavy butters (shea butter, cocoa butter)
* Rich oils (coconut oil, castor oil)
* Multiple moisturizing ingredients

This makes them potentially:
* **Great for**: [High porosity](/porosity/high-porosity), coarse, or very dry hair
* **Challenging for**: Fine, [low porosity](/porosity/low-porosity), or easily weighed-down hair

The Curl Smoothie: A Community Favorite
-------------------------------

Despite concerns about formula changes and product weight, the [Coconut & Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie remains one of the most beloved products in the curly hair community](https://amzn.to/4gHGC5A). This thick, creamy styling cream is particularly popular because:

* **Versatility**: Works as both a leave-in and styler
* **Moisture**: Provides long-lasting hydration
* **Definition**: Helps enhance natural curl pattern
* **Value**: A little goes a long way
* **Accessibility**: Widely available at various price points

However, like most Shea Moisture products, the Curl Smoothie works best for:
* Medium to thick hair textures
* High porosity hair
* Those needing intense moisture
* Type 3 and 4 curls

For fine or low porosity hair, try using it:
* As an occasional deep treatment
* Mixed with water to dilute
* Only on the ends of hair
* In very small amounts

Making Shea Moisture Work for You
-------------------------------

If you want to try Shea Moisture products:

1. **Know Your Hair Type**:
   * Take our [porosity quiz](/porosity-quiz)
   * Consider your hair's density and strand thickness
   * Understand your moisture needs

2. **Application Tips for Lighter Results**:
   * Use less product than suggested
   * Apply to very wet hair
   * Focus on ends, avoid roots
   * Dilute products with water
   * Use as occasional deep treatments rather than daily products

3. **Product Selection**:
   * Look for their lighter lines (products with "weightless" or "fine hair" in the name)
   * Avoid products with multiple butters and oils in the first few ingredients
   * Consider using their styling products rather than leave-ins
   * Check ingredients using our [analyzer](/)

Alternative Options
-----------------

If Shea Moisture proves too heavy, here are some lighter alternatives our community has had success with:

1. **Lighter Products We Recommend**:
   * [MopTop Light Conditioner](https://amzn.to/2ApLXiq) - specifically formulated for low porosity hair
   * [Innersense I Create Volume](https://amzn.to/3ZXk3o3) - great for adding volume without weight
   * [Kristin Ess Curl Shampoo](https://amzn.to/49LHTpT) - gentle cleansing for low/normal porosity hair

2. **Other Brands to Consider**:
   * Jessicurl
   * Giovanni
   * Kinky-Curly
   * Not Your Mother's Naturals

3. **Product Types to Look For**:
   * Water-based formulas
   * Gel-based stylers
   * Foam products
   * Lightweight leave-ins

The Bottom Line
-------------

Shea Moisture can be an excellent choice for some hair types, particularly those needing intense moisture. However, if you have fine or low porosity hair, you might need to:
* Be selective about which products you choose
* Modify your application technique
* Consider lighter alternatives

Remember that what works for others may not work for you. Always check ingredients and consider your hair's specific needs when choosing products.
