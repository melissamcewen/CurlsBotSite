Understanding Shea Moisture Products
----------------------------------

Shea Moisture is a popular brand in the curly hair community, known for their natural ingredients and moisturizing formulas. However, like any brand, not all their products may be suitable for every curly hair routine. Product formulations can change over time, so it's important to always check the ingredients list rather than assuming a product is curl-friendly just because of the brand name.

What to Look For
---------------

When checking any Shea Moisture product (or any hair product), here are the main categories of ingredients to watch out for:

### Harsh Cleansers

Some cleansers can be too stripping for curly hair. Watch out for:
* Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS)
* Ammonium lauryl sulfate
* Sodium laureth sulfate (SLES)

Note: Some gentler cleansers like sodium cocoyl isethionate or cocamidopropyl betaine are generally considered curl-friendly.

### Alcohols

Not all alcohols are created equal. Here's what to know:

**Drying Alcohols to Avoid:**
* Denatured alcohol (Alcohol Denat.)
* SD Alcohol
* Ethanol
* Isopropyl alcohol
* Propanol

**Beneficial Alcohols (These are OK):**
* Cetyl alcohol
* Stearyl alcohol
* Cetearyl alcohol
* Behenyl alcohol

### Waxes and Heavy Oils

These can cause buildup, especially for fine or low porosity hair:
* Beeswax
* Candelilla wax
* Microcrystalline wax
* Heavy butters in large quantities
* Non-water soluble silicones

### Silicone Derivatives

Some ingredients can behave like silicones and may cause buildup:
* Dimethiconol cysteine
* Hydrolyzed vegetable protein PG-propyl silanetriol

How to Check Products
-------------------

1. **Use Our Analyzer:**
   * Copy the ingredients list from the product
   * Paste it into our [ingredient analyzer](/ingredients)
   * Review any flagged ingredients

2. **Check the Product Position:**
   * Consider your hair's needs (porosity, density, etc.)
   * Look at where potentially problematic ingredients appear in the list
   * Earlier in the list = higher concentration

3. **Consider Your Hair Type:**
   * Low porosity hair may be more prone to buildup
   * High porosity hair might need more moisture
   * Fine hair may be weighed down by heavy ingredients

Making Informed Decisions
-----------------------

Remember:
* Product formulations can change
* Always check current ingredients lists
* What works for others may not work for you
* Consider your specific hair needs
* When in doubt, patch test new products
