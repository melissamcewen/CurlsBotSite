I first noticed my hair changing when I was around 38. For most of my life I had an oily scalp and hair that was more likely to look greasy than feel "dry". But at 38 my scalp started feeling drier, and the hair at the front top of my head became frizzy and straw-like. I also started getting odd, irregular hairs that stuck up and refused to behave.

I did not connect any of this to hormones. Menopause felt like a distant future problem, not something relevant to my late thirties.

What I did not realize at the time is that menopause is preceded by a period called **perimenopause**, and that it can begin years earlier than most people expect. Perimenopause involves hormonal fluctuation, and those changes can affect both the scalp and the hair follicles.

I was not alone in missing this connection. One study found that 47 percent of women reported not being informed about the impact of menopause on their skin and hair (Bravo). This guide is my attempt to fill that gap, with a focus on understanding what is happening and what you can realistically do about it.

This article does not cover medical treatments for hormonal conditions or hair loss disorders. Hormonal transition overlaps with several medical causes of hair loss, and those require evaluation by a clinician <InlineReference id="168" /> The focus here is everyday haircare and scalpcare, and making sense of changes that often feel confusing and unexplained.

## TLDR
- Perimenopause is the multi-year transition before menopause and can begin as early as the late thirties
- During perimenopause, estrogen levels fluctuate rather than steadily decline
- These hormonal shifts can affect hair growth cycles, follicle quality, scalp condition, and sebum production
- Common effects include a drier scalp, rougher or frizzier hair, finer strands, increased shedding, and gradual density changes

What tends to help:
- More conditioning and lubrication to compensate for reduced sebum
- Scalp care that treats the scalp like aging skin, boosting blood flow, protecting from oxidative damage, and providing moisture
- Mechanical protection such as low-tension styles and reduced friction during sleep

## What is Perimenopause
Perimenopause is the transitional period leading up to menopause, when reproductive hormones begin to fluctuate. Menopause itself is defined as the point when someone has gone twelve consecutive months without a menstrual period <InlineReference id="169" />.

Perimenopause typically begins in the mid-40s and can last around four years on average, but the age at onset and duration vary widely from person to person. Some people notice changes in their late thirties, while others may not notice perimenopausal symptoms until their early 50s <InlineReference id="170" />.

  caption="An example of how estrogens may fluctuate during perimenopause, but remember it's different for everyone"

/>

During perimenopause, estrogen and other hormone levels rise and fall irregularly rather than declining steadily, which can have effects across the body, including on hair follicles and the scalp.


## What's going on with my hair and scalp in perimenopause

During perimenopause, changes to hair and scalp rarely have a single cause. Instead, several overlapping processes are happening at once. Hormonal fluctuation can affect how long hairs stay in their growth phase, the quality of the hair produced by each follicle, and the condition of the scalp itself.

These changes do not happen evenly or predictably. Some people notice slower growth, others notice more shedding, rougher texture, or a scalp that suddenly behaves differently than it used to. Often, it is a combination of all of these.

Below I break down the main mechanisms involved and explain how each one tends to show up in real life, so the changes you are seeing feel less mysterious and the practical recommendations later make more sense.

### The anagen (growth) phase shortens

Hair grows in cycles. The growth phase, called anagen, is when a hair fiber is actively produced. How long a hair stays in anagen determines how long it can grow and how many hairs are growing at any given time.

<BlogImage
  src="/images/blog/hair-scalp-care-perimenopause-guide/growth.png"
  alt="The phases of the hair growth cycle: anagen (growing), catagen (shrinking), and telogen (resting), at the end the hair sheds and anagen starts again"
  caption="The anagen phase is when hair is actually growing, if its shortened then hair will not grow as long"
  float="left"
/>

Estrogen plays a role in supporting this growth phase <InlineReference id="171" />. During perimenopause, fluctuating estrogen signaling is associated with a shorter anagen phase for some follicles <InlineReference id="172" />. At the same time, hormones such as DHT, known to also shorten anagen, do not decline in parallel, which shifts the hormonal balance in a way that can further shorten growth time for susceptible hairs.

The practical result is that fewer hairs are in active growth at once. Hair may grow more slowly, take longer to replace shed hairs, and gradually appear less dense, even in the absence of dramatic shedding <InlineReference id="173" />.

This is one reason hair changes in perimenopause often feel subtle but cumulative rather than sudden.

### Follicles get less support and produce lower-quality hair

The hair fiber you see is produced by the follicle, and changes in the follicle’s environment can affect more than just how fast hair grows. During perimenopause and with aging more generally, follicles tend to receive less consistent support, including reduced blood supply and changes in the surrounding tissue <InlineReference id="174" />.

<BlogImage
  src="/images/blog/hair-scalp-care-perimenopause-guide/follicle.png"
  alt="Illustration of a healthy follicle (left) and a poor follicle environment with less support, stiffness, and inflammation(right), and the hair less securely attached to the scalp"
  caption="A poor follicle environment can lead to lower-quality hair that's less well-attached to the scalp"
  float="left"
/>

When follicles are less well supported, they often produce finer hairs that are more fragile <InlineReference id="173" />. Beyond size, research suggests that follicle health also affects the regularity of the hair fiber itself <InlineReference id="175" />. This can lead to hairs that feel rough, tangle easily, and read visually as frizz, even when you have not changed your routine <InlineReference id="173" />. It can also lead to hairs with an irregular pattern that's more chaotic than curly/wavy, sometimes called "meandering hairs" in the literature <InlineReference id="89" />.

<BlogImage

  alt="Three side-by-side images showing hair from panelists aged 25, 40, and 57. Beneath each photo is a traced outline of individual hair fibers. The hair fibers appear relatively straight and uniform at age 25, increasingly curved and irregular at age 40, and more meandering and uneven at age 57."

/>

Follicles also lose some of the fatty tissue that helps cushion and stabilize the hair as it grows <InlineReference id="176" />. This may make hairs easier to dislodge during everyday grooming, contributing to increased shedding that feels disproportionate to the amount of hair on your head.

In other words, some of what people interpret as “dryness” or “damage” is actually a change in the quality of the hair being produced.


### Sebum production declines

Sebum is the scalp’s natural lubricant. It is a mixture of lipids that helps protect the scalp and reduces friction along the hair shaft. In looser hair types, sebum can travel farther down the hair, contributing to shine, slip, and easier detangling. In tighter curl patterns, it tends to stay closer to the scalp, so changes in sebum distribution may be less noticeable along the length <InlineReference id="71" />.

Research shows that sebum production declines during perimenopause and after menopause <InlineReference id="173" />. How much of this change is driven directly by estrogen versus general aging is not fully clear, but the decline is more pronounced in women than in men.

For people who have always had oily scalps, this shift can initially feel like a relief. Over time, though, reduced sebum often shows up as hair that feels rougher, tangles more easily, and loses shine more quickly <InlineReference id="177" />. Many people interpret this as their hair becoming “dry,” when it is more accurately a loss of lubrication.

Before perimenopause, I rarely experienced "dryness". But when my sebum production declined, especially at the front top of my scalp, managing texture and frizz became noticeably harder.

What this means: less natural lubrication, more friction, and hair that requires external conditioning to behave the way it used to.

### Scalp skin integrity declines
The scalp is skin, and it is affected both by hormonal changes and by the general aging process. Over time, skin loses structural integrity and elasticity as collagen production declines and the surrounding tissue changes <InlineReference id="176" />.

When the scalp’s structure weakens, it can affect how securely hair sits in the follicle. This is sometimes described as reduced “anchoring” <InlineReference id="175" />. Hair is not falling out spontaneously, but it may be easier to dislodge during normal activities such as washing, brushing, or styling.

This helps explain why shedding during everyday grooming can increase during perimenopause, even when overall hair density has not changed dramatically. The hair itself may be the same age and length as before, but the environment holding it in place is less resilient.

## Why the changes are uneven

One of the most confusing aspects of perimenopause-related hair changes is how inconsistent they can be. This is partly because estrogen levels fluctuate during perimenopause rather than declining smoothly. Symptoms can appear, recede, and reappear over time, sometimes without a clear pattern.

Hair follicles also do not respond uniformly across the scalp. Different regions contain different densities of hormone receptors and have different sensitivities to hormonal signaling <InlineReference id="178" />. As a result, some areas are more affected by hormonal fluctuation than others.

Studies suggest that changes are most noticeable at the front and top of the scalp <InlineReference id="178" />. At the same time, increased growth in less-welcome areas can occur elsewhere on the body <InlineReference id="179" />. In my case, I noticed reduced density on my temple alongside the sudden appearance of a long, stubborn chin hair.

<BlogImage
  src="/images/blog/hair-scalp-care-perimenopause-guide/scalp-region.png"
  alt="Picture of hair loss on the temple with an inset diagram showing the front region of the scalp"
  caption="The front areas of the scalp are likely to be the most affected by hormonal changes"
  float="left"
/>

This unevenness does not mean something is wrong. It reflects the way different follicles respond to the same hormonal environment, and it helps explain why a routine that once worked uniformly may now need to be more targeted.

### Hair products

As sebum production declines and hair quality becomes less uniform, products take on a more compensatory role. The goal is not to “fix” the hair, but to replace lost lubrication, reduce friction, and protect more delicate strands from damage during normal washing and styling.

Before washing, protecting the ends can reduce friction and breakage. When my hair is longer, I use a pre-wash oil on the ends to help buffer them from the cleansing process.

During washing, slip matters more than it used to. Shampoos that cleanse effectively while providing lubrication can reduce shedding caused by mechanical stress. I use Bounce Curl Gentle Clarifying for this reason. At least once a week, I also use an anti-fungal shampoo such as Nizoral. [Even in the absence of dandruff, there is evidence that ketoconazole can support scalp health and density](https://tressless.com/search/ketoconazole).

Because declining sebum affects how hair behaves along the length, conditioning becomes more important, particularly leave-in conditioning. Many people find they need more conditioning than they used to, or that it needs to be applied more strategically. I section my hair and apply heavier leave-ins only to areas that feel rough or dry, mainly the front and top of my scalp. Products designed to mimic sebum can be especially helpful here.

As hair becomes more fragile, added protection from friction and UV exposure can also be useful. I look for leave-ins that provide this kind of surface protection.

  subtitle="A great example of a leave in that provides friction, heat, and UV protection all in one. I find this light enough to layer with other products."

For irregular or “meandering” hairs, deep conditioning can improve manageability by increasing softness and flexibility. This does not change how the hair grows, but it can make styling far less frustrating.

Finally, stronger hold products such as gels or mousses can help control halo frizz and keep irregular hairs in place, reducing the need for repeated manipulation throughout the day.

### Hair habits

As hair becomes more fragile and less securely held in place, mechanical stress from everyday habits becomes a major contributor to shedding and breakage. In this phase, how you handle your hair often matters as much as what products you use.

Reducing tension and manipulation is key. This includes minimizing aggressive brushing, avoiding styles that pull tightly on the hair, and being cautious with anything that involves repeated installation and removal, such as extensions or elaborate protective styles. Even routines that once felt gentle can start to carry a higher cost when hair is easier to dislodge.

Small changes in accessories can also make a difference. Swapping metal or rubber hair ties for satin scrunchies or gentle claw clips reduces localized stress and friction.

During the day, protecting hair from environmental exposure can help limit cumulative damage. Low-tension styles that keep hair contained, along with hats for UV protection when appropriate, reduce friction and handling.

Sleep is another overlooked source of mechanical stress. Friction from tossing and turning can roughen the hair surface and increase breakage. I use satin bonnets and keep a satin pillowcase as backup when the bonnet inevitably comes off. When my hair is long, I often put it into loose, low-tension braids overnight to limit movement.

### Scalp care

The scalp is skin, and like the skin on the rest of the body, it changes with age and hormonal transition. During perimenopause, maintaining a stable, low-irritation scalp environment becomes more important, particularly as reduced skin integrity can contribute to increased shedding during everyday grooming.

Regular washing helps limit irritation from microbial overgrowth and sebum oxidation, [both of which can negatively affect scalp health](/blog/can-curly-routines-products-cause-dandruff). I already had a history of scalp issues, so I was accustomed to washing at least once a week and using anti-fungal shampoos when needed. There is also evidence that certain anti-fungal actives, such as ketoconazole (in Nizoral), [can support scalp health and may help preserve density over time](https://tressless.com/search/ketoconazole).

In addition to cleansing, some people choose to use leave-on scalp products formulated to support aging skin. These typically aim to reduce inflammation, provide antioxidant protection, or improve the overall scalp environment. While the evidence for cosmetic scalp serums is mixed, they may offer modest benefits when used consistently.

When evaluating scalp serums, I look for products that include:
- Ingredients associated with improved blood flow or reduced inflammation
- Compounds intended to support the scalp’s structural integrity
- Antioxidants that may help limit cumulative damage

It is important to keep expectations realistic. These are cosmetic products, not medications, and they will not override hormonal changes. They take months of consistent use to show visible results if they do anything. At best, they support the scalp environment so hair is growing under more favorable conditions.

This kind of support becomes more meaningful when combined with gentle handling and adequate conditioning of the hair itself.

### My full product routine

This is the routine I arrived at through a mix of trial and error and research. It reflects my hair type, scalp history, and where my changes have been most noticeable. It is not meant as a prescription, but as an example of how the principles discussed above can be applied in practice.

- Deep condition as a pre-wash about once every two weeks, usually under a conditioning cap, to soften irregular hairs and improve manageability
- Apply pre-wash oil to the ends when my hair is longer, to reduce friction during washing
- Use Nizoral shampoo on my scalp at least once a week, with a gentler shampoo for the rest of my hair
- Use Bounce Curl Gentle Clarifying shampoo on other wash days
- Use a lightweight rinse-out conditioner, since only part of my hair tends to feel dry
- Apply Color Wow Flo-etry selectively to drier areas, mainly at the front and top
- Apply Pantene 10 in 1 more broadly for surface protection
- Use MopTop Anti-Frizz gel for hold and to control halo frizz
- Apply density serum daily to the scalp

This routine prioritizes protection, lubrication, and reduced handling over aggressive treatment.


## When to see a medical professional

While many hair and scalp changes during perimenopause are common, some patterns warrant medical evaluation. If you are experiencing rapid or severe hair loss, patchy thinning, scalp pain, or symptoms that feel out of proportion to what is described here, it is appropriate to see a clinician.

Hormonal transition can overlap with medical causes of hair loss, including thyroid disorders, nutritional deficiencies, and other conditions that require diagnosis and treatment. Cosmetic hair and scalp care can support manageability and comfort, but it cannot address these underlying issues.

I chose to pursue medical evaluation myself, including screening for thyroid function and nutritional deficiencies. Knowing those results gave me peace of mind and helped me focus on what could realistically be addressed through everyday care.

## Living with hair changes in perimenopause

Learning about perimenopause helped me make sense of changes that had felt sudden and personal. Understanding what was happening biologically allowed me to stop chasing fixes and instead focus on building a routine that supported my hair and scalp as they are now.

Not all of the changes have been negative. My scalp is no longer as oily as it once was, and I have experimented with products I never would have considered before. More importantly, I feel less confused and less reactive when my hair behaves differently than it used to.

Between working with my doctor and adjusting my everyday hair and scalp care, I feel better equipped to manage this transition. My goal is not to freeze my hair in time, but to protect it, reduce unnecessary loss, and keep it as manageable and healthy-looking as possible.

If you are noticing similar changes, I hope this guide helps you understand what is happening and gives you practical tools to respond without panic.

## FAQ

### What about hair growth supplements?

There is no evidence that vitamins can boost hair growth unless you have a specific deficiency. In my case I was surprised to find that I DID have a deficiency, which is another great reason to talk to your doctor about your specific situation. There is some preliminary [evidence with collagen peptides.](https://examine.com/refer/huntgatherlove?loc=/supplements/collagen). Given that my doctor was already recommending a multivitamin, I am looking at some with collagen peptides but haven't chosen one. I noticed a lot of vitamins said "collagen boosting" or "vegan collagen" -- these don't actually contain collagen peptides. I may add to this article as I learn more, so make sure to sign up for our mailing list to get notified when I update it.

### What about the effect of graying hair?

There is some evidence that graying hair may be [higher porosity, but the significance of this is not clear](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/). It is also known to be more vulnerable to UV damage <InlineReference id="180" />.
