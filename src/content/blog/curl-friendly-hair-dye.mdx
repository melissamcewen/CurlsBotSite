## Curl-Friendly Hair Dyes

Many people want to maintain their curly hair care routine while still enjoying the creative freedom of hair coloring. While most conventional hair dyes contain ingredients that can be damaging or leave buildup, there are several curl-friendly options available in 2024.



## Henna: 100% natural but is it good for curls?

Henna and curls could be the subject of an entire blog post on its own, but here's a summary of the most important points.

Henna has a gotten a bad reputation because of products labeled "henna" that are not actually henna. These products are often made with metal salts and other chemicals that can damage the hair and react with other dyes and bleach.

If you use 100% pure henna from a reputable source, it is an excellent choice for dye. It strengthens and conditions the hair, and the color never fades.

What's the catch?

1. It is 100% permanent and cannot be removed.
2. Color options are limited. Henna itself is just orange red, you can mix with indigo to get browns and blacks.
3. It takes time to research and learn the process, create your mix, apply it, and wait for it to work. Average time is 3-6 hours to dye hair with natural henna, not including the time to prepare the dye, which is best when it is dye released overnight.
4. And the most important one for curls: it is known to weigh down curls because it bonds to the hair.

So maybe it is both truly the best and worst dye for curls. It won't damage them, but it will make them softer. Some people want that, others don't. I have used henna for many years and my hair is definitely more wavy than curly, but I love the way it looks.

Some people report that using amla, an Indian herb that is mixed in with henna, can help with curl retention. There isn't a ton of research on this, but it is worth a try.

This is the henna mix I use:

- [Amla](https://amzn.to/3PbXEwQ): For dye release, you mix it in with the henna and distilled and wait overnight. Amla is supposed to help with curl retention and to achieve a cooler color.
- [Rajastani Twilight Henna](https://amzn.to/49WcfGA)

I also use [Ancient Sunrise's rainwash](https://amzn.to/3P8Tnus) to clarify my hair before dyeing.

You can [also get Ancient Sunrise's products in a kit form with all the ingredients pre-measured](https://amzn.to/49WcfGA). I find that kits and making your own mix is the best way to go, in terms of being able to control what color you get.

### Tips for Using Henna:

1. **Source Quality Products**: Purchase from reputable brands that sell pure, body-art quality henna like [Ancient Sunrise](https://amzn.to/3VOhz8Q). Avoid compound henna or products with added ingredients.

2. **Proper Preparation**:

   - Always do a strand test
   - Clarify hair thoroughly before application
   - If you have hard water, use a chelating treatment first
   - Consider using protein-free products afterward as henna provides protein-like benefits

3. **Research**: Read [Ancient Sunrise's comprehensive henna guide](https://www.ancientsunrise.blog/henna-hair-book/) before starting.

## Direct Dyes: A Temporary Option

Direct dyes are sometimes called "semi-permanent" dyes. They are a perfect option for those who don't want the commitment of henna or the damage of oxidative permanent dyes. Oxidative permanent dyes changed the sturcture of your hair, while direct dyes just leave a stain of color on the surface.

The main disadvantage is that they are not permanent and will wash out over time. Plus they cannot lighten your hair and may not have as much of an effect on dark hair.

Most have silicones, but I recently found one that's silicone-free called [Glaze](https://sovrn.co/1pd2um5). I haven't tried it yet, but I'm excited to see how it works.


A potential alternative is non-henna herbal dyes, but they are usually not very effective and more research is needed. If you're interested in the subject, join the [Natural Hair Dye Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/naturalhairdye/), which I moderate.

## Color Wax: A super temporary option

Color wax is pretty cool because usually it does double duty as a hair gel. It washes out in one wash. The major disadvantage is right in the name: wax. The product is very heavy and can weight down wavy hair. If you're 3C and above it can look ingredible. As someone who personally has 2C hair, it just made my hair straight and greasy when I applied it as recommended on wet hair. One solution is to just use a little of the color on dry hair for some nice streaks. This has worked well for me.

Also as a waxy product, it may not wash out completely if you only use cowash or a gentle shampoo. Luckily since it has a color you'll be able to see if it's still there, so you can wash it out with a clarifying shampoo.

Some of the best options are:

- [As I Am Curl Color](https://amzn.to/3PnS4I0)
- [ORS Color Blast](https://amzn.to/406qFiB)
- [CurlSmith Hair Makeup](https://sovrn.co/1hetz0d)- This one has slightly lighter ingredients and I'm hoping to try it soon, maybe it will work better for me.

## Chemical Dyes: The Best Options and Protecting Your Curls

While chemical dyes will always cause some level of damage, you can minimize the impact on your curls with the right approach.

The best choice is to see a professional. They can use a gentler technique like balayage or demi-permanent color.

### "Herbal" box dyes

These are conventional oxidative box dyes that are marketed as "herbal" or "natural". They are not 100% natural, but they may be gentler than other box dyes.

### Post-Dye Care

Chemical dyes typically make hair more [porous (high porosity)](/porosity/high-porosity). In terms of curlsbot ingredients analysis, look for products that have mild detergents.

Some curly hair products are designed for colored hair. For example, [Innersense's "Awaken Color" line](https://amzn.to/4fxCMep):

- [Color Awakening Hairbath](https://amzn.to/4iG1fRH) (this is a mild shampoo)
- [Color Radiance Daily Conditioner](https://amzn.to/4iKAWtv)
