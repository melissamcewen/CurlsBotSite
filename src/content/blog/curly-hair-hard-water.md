Understanding Hard Water and Your Curls
-------------------

If you're following a curly hair routine and experiencing persistent buildup or lackluster curls despite using the right products, hard water might be the culprit. This is especially common if your curls look great when you travel but struggle at home.

What is Hard Water?
-------------------

Hard water contains high levels of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. You likely have hard water if you notice:
- White residue on faucets, shower heads, or kettles
- [Soap scum that's difficult to clean](/blog/is-soap-good-for-curls)
- Spots on dishes after washing
- Reduced soap lather

Most of the United States has moderate to hard water. You can check your area's water hardness through your local water utility's annual report or use [inexpensive test strips](https://amzn.to/40654Iz) for a quick assessment.

How Hard Water Affects Curly Hair
-------------------

Hard water can:
- Create a coating on hair that blocks moisture
- Combine with products to form stubborn residue
- Make hair feel dry and brittle
- Cause color fading
- Reduce product effectiveness
- Lead to scalp buildup
- Make hair look dull and feel weighed down

Solutions for Hard Water
-------------------

### 1. Clarifying Treatments

Regular clarifying is essential with hard water. Options include:
- Chelating treatments like [Malibu C Demineralizer](https://amzn.to/4gOtwUq) and their special one for curly hair [Malibu C Curl Partner Wellness Remedy](https://amzn.to/3BIoNVg)
- Ion Crystal Clarifying Treatment
- DIY apple cider vinegar rinses (1 part vinegar to 3 parts water)

Use these treatments monthly or as needed when you notice buildup. Not that most contain acids and strong [detergents](/groups/detergents), so they can be harsh on your hair. Definitely don't use them too often, and it might help to deep condition after using them.

### 2. Hard Water Specific Products

Use products designed for hard water:
- [Malibu Hard Water Wellness Shampoo](https://amzn.to/4golOk0)
- Chelating shampoos (containing EDTA or other chelating agents)
- Ion Hard Water Shampoo

### 3. Prevention Tips

Adjust your routine to minimize buildup:
- Keep styling products away from your roots
- Avoid products with heavy oils or butters near the scalp
- Use lighter, water-soluble products
- Deep condition only mid-shaft to ends
- Clarify regularly before buildup becomes severe
- Don't use [soap-based products](/blog/is-soap-good-for-curls) as they react with hard water to create even more buildup

### 4. Water Filtration Options

Consider these solutions based on your budget and needs:

**Shower Filters** ($30-50):
- [AquaBliss High Output Universal Shower Filter](http://amzn.to/2CwM9bJ)
- Helps reduce chlorine and some minerals
- Requires periodic filter replacement
- More affordable but less effective than water softeners

**Portable Water Softeners** ($200-300):
- [ShowerStick](https://watersticks.com/)
- More effective at removing minerals
- Requires regular regeneration
- Good for renters

**Whole House Systems** ($500+):
- Most effective solution
- Requires professional installation
- Best for homeowners
- Benefits all water usage in home

Remember: What works best can vary based on your water hardness, [hair porosity](/porosity-quiz), and styling routine. Start with clarifying treatments and hard water specific products before investing in filtration systems.
