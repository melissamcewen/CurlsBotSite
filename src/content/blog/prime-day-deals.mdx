Prime Day is a way to get some of the more premium and innovative curly products at a 20% discount. Here are my top 5 picks for this year.


## [COLOR WOW Curl Wow Flo-etry Vital Natural Serum](https://amzn.to/3TudNjz)

If you have low porosity or fine hair, you know the struggle with oils. Oils can just sit on your strands, weighing them down and looking greasy. The cosmetic chemists at Color Wow solved this problem with Flo-etry with a process that breaks up the oils so they can easily disperse through the hair. I use this one as a leave in on its own or under a styler with hold like Inhasi Custard

## [Define & Shine Mango Papaya Curl Defining Custard](https://amzn.to/4lKqrXP)

People often ask why custard? Custard is usually a lot softer and used in smaller amounts than gel. If your hair easily looks stringy or you've never had much success with "scrunch out the crunch" custards like this are the perfect solution.

## [Eva NYC Mane Magic](https://amzn.to/4krflFS)

Sun and heat protection is key, especially for those of us with high or mixed porosity (high porosity ends). I love spray leave ins like this because they are easier to distribute than regular cream leave ins. I section my hair and spray each section with this spray before I use my BounceCurl Brush

## [BounceCurl Brush](https://amzn.to/4krflFS)

This brush really does live up to the hype. It helps me avoid the dreaded "weird area in the back of my head" and align my fine strands.

## [Malibu C Hard Water Wellness Treatment](https://amzn.to/4eDQoWF)

I have really hard water and I've never had any success with hard water shampoos. Crystal treatments that come in packets do a bunch better job in my experience of gently and completely removing hard water deposits from hair.
