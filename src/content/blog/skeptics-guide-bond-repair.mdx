If you have ever stared at a shelf full of “bond repair” products and wondered why everything suddenly claims to fix your hair’s internal structure? Well, you are not alone. I researched so-called "bond repair" products for months to write this guide.

What I uncovered is that not all bond repair products are alike. Some target the strong internal bonds that actually matter for curl integrity. Others build weak, temporary bonds using ingredients that are common in just regular conditioners. And the labels rarely help you figure out which is which.

So this guide is here to cut through the noise. If your hair is damaged, fragile, high porosity, or just not behaving the way it used to, I want to help you understand which products can genuinely make a difference and which ones are mostly buzzwords. By the end, you’ll know what type of bond repair your hair actually needs, when it is worth investing in stronger systems, and when a well formulated drugstore product will do the job just as well.

**Update Jan 7, 2026**: Added section on [Terabond](#terabond), added info/videos from tests I did with Garnier and Curlsmith to ["Can you benefit from bonding products if your hair is low porosity (undamaged)"](#can-you-benefit-from-bonding-products-if-your-hair-is-low-porosity-undamaged), added like to Flotje's excellent video on bond repair to [Further Resources](#further-resources).

## TLDR

There are **two major types of bond repair products**:
*strong* and *weak*. They do not work the same way.

There are only FOUR major *strong* bond repair products: Olaplex, Epres, k18, and Living Proof Triple Bond Complex. And they are pretty expensive.

**These strong bond repair products target COVALENT bonds like Disulfide bonds**, which are strong bonds that are really only broken in two situations
- Chemical processing (bleaching, perming, relaxing, keratin treatments, etc.)
- Extreme heat damage

**If you don't have those specific types of damage, you really don't need strong bond repair products.**

But if you do, **the best use of them is DURING chemical treatments at the salon**, using the professional versions of Olaplex or k18.

**At home I'd prioritize Olaplex OR Epres (they have similar mechanisms)** over the other choices. But if you're REALLY into mitigating damage you can add on [k18](https://amzn.to/3XzkDpV) AND/OR [Living Proof Triple Bond Complex](https://amzn.to/3XzkDpV) since they work differently.

**Always prioritize the treatments**. The matching shampoos, conditioners, leave-ins etc. have less of the active. They may help but the evidence is sketchy.

If your hair is high porosity ([find your porosity type here](/porosity/quiz)), from everyday wear and tear or from lighter chemical services like highlights or box dye, the **weak bond builders** might help, but most of them are basically well formulated conditioners with trendy language. They might not work any better than the "repair" deep conditioner you already use.

But if you want to try them out, my top weak bond picks are:

<BlogProductGrid columns={2}>
<BlogProduct

  image="/images/blog/skeptics-guide-bond-repair/pantene.png"
  amazonLink="https://amzn.to/4a6ask2"
/>
</BlogProductGrid>

Both have good science behind them, work well, and are affordable.

In the end don't think of bond repair as an essential part of hair care routines. Other conditioning products can provide similar results.

## What Are Bond Repair Products?
Well, there is no regulation or standardized definition but Dr. Paul Corwell of the Tri-Princeton Institute and Dr. Jennifer Marsh are two experts who have proposed defining it as product with ingredients that penetrate into the cortex, improves or restores its internal structure, and enhances mechanical properties <InlineReference id="145" />. That is the definition I'm going to use because if we just counted anything that creates any bonds anywhere, I'd have to include basically every conditioner on the market.

Penetration is actually not easy to do, even in damaged hair where the cuticle has cracks. Even an impaired cuticle provides an obstacle to ingredients getting in. Chemists have come up with ways to get around this like making the active smaller and altering its charge.

For structural changes in the cortex this can be really hard to prove and well, expensive. Since there are no consequences for making inaccurate claims about bonding, it's no surprise that most brands don't bother.

With "enhancing mechanical properties" that means increasing the hair's strength, resistance to heat, and flexibility. But remember it's also something a lot of conventional conditioners do.


## Strong Bond Repair Products
Strong bond repair products target covalent disulfide bonds. These bonds:

* Hold the structure of the hair cortex together
* Give curls their shape (the curlier your hair is, the more of these bonds you have <InlineReference id="80" />)
* Are very strong
* Are only broken by strong chemical processes (bleaching, coloring, perming, relaxing, keratin treatments, etc.) or extreme heat

When these break, your curl structure can be damaged.

There are ONLY four major products available to consumers that claim to repair strong, covalent bonds:

### Do they really repair disulfide bonds

One of the major problems with these "bond repair" products is that the evidence supporting their claims is weak. That's why you're not going to find any diagrams in this post like you might see elsewhere. Those diagrams probably aren't correct.

Because these products are based on patented trade secrets it's hard to learn how they actually work. I had to base my research on their patents, two independent peer reviewed studies (one with both k18 and Olaplex, one with just Olaplex)<InlineReference id="138" /><InlineReference id="139" />, and some papers describing similar systems in the case of Living Proof's product<InlineReference id="140" />.

None of the independent studies found proof that these products rebuild disulfide bonds directly. That part of the marketing appears to be wishful thinking. But the research does show evidence of **other covalent bonds forming**, which is still meaningful because covalent bonds are the strongest bonds you can put in hair.

So they are doing something, it's just not what the cute diagrams on the brands’ blogs suggest. These diagrams typically show "cross linking" which is connecting the end of one broken cysteine residue to another, forming a connection. When in reality it seems like for Olaplex at least that it's just capping the ends of the broken bonds, which is useful but not what the diagrams suggest. k18 the one study it was in didn't really show it doing anything on the cortex, it seemed to be more of a conditioner.

### When to Use Strong Bond Builders
Reading the patents I was interested in how many of them described systems used DURING chemical processing (like bleaching) of hair rather than afterwards.

If these products are capable of repairing disulfide bonds, it's most likely this would occur during or shortly after chemical processing.

This is the window where the internal structure is disrupted and ingredients can interact with reactive sites in the hair. Once the hair is already damaged and stabilized, the effect is weaker.

So my top recommendation would be if you're heavily processing your hair at a salon, have your stylist include one of the strong bond building products! I'd pick Olaplex or Epres personally. This can make a massive difference for extreme types of processing like bleaching dark hair into very light colors.

Post processing or if you do processing at home, the at-home treatments may help but not as dramatically.

### The new Olaplex for curls

Olaplex released a curl-focused system called [Bond Shaper](https://olaplex.com/products/pro-olaplex-bond-shaper-curl) that uses a peptide called Oligopeptide-300. There is almost no publicly available technical info and it's only available for professional stylist use in salons.

The [Olaplex Bond Shaper gel](https://amzn.to/4nYS0gF) contains the standard Olaplex active (Bis-Aminopropyl Diglycol Dimaleate) and not the new peptide.

I wish I knew more about the science of these products but there is little info on either the new active Oligopeptide-300 or on whether the old active Bis-Aminopropyl Diglycol Dimaleate would be helpful in a gel.

### Are these protein treatments?

Olaplex, Epres, and Living Proof Triple Bond have no protein or protein derivatives in them.

k18 is based on a peptide. Amino acids make up peptides, and peptides make up proteins.

Proteins derivatives like peptides are extremely diverse and I don't see any plausible reason they could cause the so-called "protein overload" condition (which is likely just [buildup, see my post on the subject](/blog/mystery-of-protein-overload-a-scientific-investigation))

k18 also DOES have Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein in it, which is a protein people commonly complain about making their hair feel stiffer.


### Can you use multiple bond repair products together?
Yes, as there are 3 different systems here so the only ones I wouldn't use together are Epres and Olaplex which use the same type of Maleate-based system. So
1. Epres OR Olaplex
2. k18
3. Living Proof Triple Bond

and of course probably as many of the weak bond repair products as you want, which I'll cover next.

### Terabond: A New Contender?
<p id="terabond"></p>
After I originally wrote this post I learned about another ingredient that claims to repair covalent (disulfide bonds). It's called [Terabond](https://acteraingredients.com/ingredient/terabond/) and it's manufactured by chemical company Actera Ingredients. It's a combo of aspergillus ferment and arginine, an amino acid.

What caught my eye about it is they [did have third party testing done on the ingredient and share at least some of the data from that](https://acteraingredients.com/wp-content/uploads/TeraBond-1.pdf). While third party tests are not quite as good as peer reviewed science, they are certainly better than the no evidence at all provided by many bond repair products like k18.

The tests were conducted by the [Textile Research Institute](https://www.triprinceton.org/) which is highly respected and I've used a lot of their resources to learn about hair science. These tests showed molecular evidence that Terabond created disulfide bonds in hair.

Their [info PDF](https://acteraingredients.com/wp-content/uploads/TeraBond-1.pdf) actually has some really interesting diagrams and what is helpful is that it tells us explicitly that it needs a trigger (an oxidizing agent) to form covalent bonds. So that makes it useful **during** chemical services like bleaching where there are tons of chemical reactions going on that can trigger Terabond's bonding power.

<BlogImage
  src="/images/blog/skeptics-guide-bond-repair/terabond.png"
  alt="Diagram showing how the TeraBond bond multiplier repairs damaged hair. Three vertical hair fiber illustrations progress from left to right: damaged fiber with bond multiplier applied, fiber after adding developer with activated bonding agents, and fully restored fiber with internal bonds rebuilt. Red dots represent bonding sites, blue stars indicate oxidizing agents during activation, and red connecting lines show restored internal bonds. Accompanying text explains that TeraBond is a reactive bond multiplier that repairs hair from the inside out, using oxidizing agents such as peroxides, developers, heat, or UV light to heal broken disulfide bonds, seal ionic bonds, form polymer chains inside keratin fibers, and reduce porosity while improving humidity resistance"
  caption="Diagram from Terabond's chemical data sheet showing how it works"
/>

So while I suspect the "big four" (Olaplex, Epres, k18) mostly work the same way, here we have documentation from the manufacturer. This tells us that Terabond will be most likely to form covalent bonds during chemical processing (bleaching/perming, etc.).

Now the question is whether this can happen when using this ingredient in everyday products like conditioner at home. Would everyday light and heat trigger it?

I looked up products that use Terabond, and none of them instructed use of heat. Also none of them specified the percentage of the ingredient in the product. The manufacturer recommends 2-8.5%.

The reason Terabond got on my radar is I noticed its in a couple of "premium" drugstore brands like Saltair's Recover and Restore and Kitsch's new Argan Oil line.

Personally if I were to pick a product with this ingredient, I'd go with a treatment like Verb's Bonding Mask, which has not only Terabond but like SO MANY different conditioners so if anything it's probably an effective conditioning mask:

<BlogProduct
  name="Verb Bonding Mask"
  subtitle="This has Terabond as an active and by the ingredients list, looks like a great conditioning mask in general"
  image="/images/blog/skeptics-guide-bond-repair/verb-bonding-mask.png"

  buyText="Buy at Ulta"
  amazonLink="https://amzn.to/4sBE6Vu"
/>

Another option is the [NYM Curl Talk Bond Building Mask](https://www.ulta.com/p/curl-talk-bond-building-mask-pimprod2036421?sku=2602795). Make sure you get this specific product because some of their other "bond" products have less exciting actives.


## Weak Bond Repair Products
Weak bond repair products do not claim to repair stronger bonds, but merely to add new bonds. These bonds:

* Are weaker (hydrogen and ionic bonds)
* More temporary
* But still could help improve hair's condition and prevent further damage by improving its structural integrity

There is sadly no real evidence these are better than regular conditioners but some of them are quite good as conditioners.

### Common Weak Bond Repair Actives

Earlier I defined bond repair ingredients as those that penetrate into the cortex, improve or restore its internal structure, and enhances mechanical properties. Under this definition there are many active ingredients that qualify but the major groupings I see are:

- Acids
	- Citric Acid (best evidence)<InlineReference id="142" />
	- Gluconic Acid: Hydroxypropyl Gluconamide on ingredient lists, promising with some theoretical and practical evidence, including the ability to temporarily mend split ends<InlineReference id="144" /><InlineReference id="147" />
- Protein derivatives which are a hugely diverse group of ingredients with varying levels of evidence behind them, and different properties based on their MW (molecular weight)<InlineReference id="143" />
	- hydrolyzed proteins like hydrolyzed keratin
	- peptides
	- amino acids like arginine, serine, and valine
- Vitamins like Panthenol<InlineReference id="141" />

### The best weak bond repair actives to look for

#### Citric Acid
Of acids my favorite is **Citric Acid**, a common ingredient that does double duty, both creating internal bonds and chelating hard water minerals, which can make a major difference in how hair looks and feels. A recent paper shows evidence that it penetrates, improves the structure of hair, and enhances its strength <InlineReference id="142" />.

#### Panthenol
Of vitamins probably the star is **panthenol** which was also the subject of a recent paper that showed it penetrating into the cortex, creating bonds inside it, and improving hair's strength <InlineReference id="141" />. Panthenol is also just a really good conditioner.

#### Hydrolyzed Keratin
One of the few actives specifically tested on curly hair. In a study it found that different weights of hydrolyzed keratin helped prevent breakage in relaxed very curly/coily hair <InlineReference id="143" />.


### Recommendations

For cost, availability, and science, my top picks are:


<BlogProductGrid title="Recommended Products" columns={2}>
<BlogProduct
  name="Garnier Fructis Hair Filler Inner Fiber Repair Pre-Shampoo Treatment"
  subtitle="A great weaker bond repair product that also could work to treat hard water buildup. Actives are citric acid and and a VERY small amount of a protein derivative."

  buyText="Buy at CVS"
  amazonLink="https://amzn.to/3Kc9x7f"
/>
<BlogProduct
  name="Pantene Pro-Vitamin Essence Weightless Leave-On Treatment"
  subtitle="I would recommend this or ANY of the Pantene Miracle Rescue line as well, for both bond repair and general conditioning. Panthenol is the main active in all of them. The Miracle Rescue line also has Keratin but this just has the amino acid histidine."
  image="/images/blog/skeptics-guide-bond-repair/pantene.png"
  amazonLink="https://amzn.to/4a6ask2"
/>
</BlogProductGrid>


These work well for [high porosity hair](/porosity/high-porosity) with mild to moderate damage without charging luxury prices. Plus they are just good products in general! The Garnier can also function as a hard water treatment if that's something you're dealing with ([see my guide on hard water](/blog/curly-hair-hard-water)).

### Special Curl Focused Bond Repair Products

There are a bunch of curl-specific bond products out there now but it's unclear what makes them better for curls than non-curl bond repair products as they mostly have the same actives. Many of them claim to have third party testing but then don't specify what type of hair they tested on. I wish more brands would be transparent about how they tested their products. Like were they tested specifically on curly hair? How did the results compare to non-curl bond repair products?


### Common Bond Repair Products

Here is a table so you can compare some common bond products
<BondProductsTable />

## Treatments vs Other Products

Many brands now have entire lines of bond repair products from pre-shampoo to stylers. The most important products are the treatments, which have the highest amount of the active ingredients.

But some of these have been designed as part of a system. When researching them you should look to see what the claims are for. Like for the Shea Moisture bond products it says the internal tests used their "4 step system", so the claims are for the system of products used together, not just single products. Though weirdly the claims say it was just compared to non-conditioning shampoo...which is not impressive. A better test would be to test against similar 4-step systems without the bonding actives.

For the actives in Dove and other Unilever products, there are some tests mentioned in the patent that say that the shampoo and conditioner do have an effect on hair strength, and the effect increases the more you use them.

So there isn’t much evidence that these are beneficial, but theoretically they could be.

The verdict:
- "Bond Repair" Shampoo: Probably just rinses out
- "Bond Repair" Conditioner: *Some* of the ingredient *may* stay in the hair...what effect that will have is unknown
- "Bond Repair" leave in products like leave in conditioners, gels, and creams: At least they aren't going down the drain, but there is also no evidence they do anything.

## The Abbey Yung Hack
Hair influencer Abbey Yung (see my [guide to her method](/blog/the-abbey-yung-method)) noticed something odd. Some bond repair treatments tell you to use them before shampoo and others say after shampoo but before conditioner. So she asked the manufacturers directly. Most told her the same thing: these treatments are generally more effective after shampoo, when the hair is clean and the active ingredients can reach the cortex more easily.

If you want to get the most out of a bond repair treatment, using it after shampoo is the better bet.

That said, many of these products need to sit for five minutes or more. Most people do not want to stand in the shower freezing while the clock runs. This is probably why some brands default to pre-poo instructions. It is less effective but more convenient.

## Can bond repair damage hair?
I have seen people complain about almost every single one of these products online, even the non-protein derived ones saying their hair was ruined.

There have been lawsuits alleging hair loss linked to Olaplex, though causation hasn’t been proven. The Beauty Brains, a podcast hosted by two cosmetic chemists, [said on Episode 329](https://music.amazon.com/es-co/podcasts/4760091f-a98f-44fd-a8a4-cb59b0ee032f/episodes/4a1e7376-1d70-41a1-838e-fbee9dd79bdb/the-beauty-brains-k18-bond-building-the-olaplex-lawsuit-and-more---episode-329) that they were skeptical that some of the ingredients the lawsuit blamed could do that type of damage.

As they say hair loss is very complex, can have so many causes. And these products are often used by people with very damaged hair. Sometimes very damaged hair just can't be saved. Or they think they can use more damaging stuff because the bond builders protect them.

Like most hair loss lawsuits, we will likely never know the answer because they are settled out of court.

## Are these products really any better than regular "hair repair" conditioning products?
That is the question I always ask. For example, one peer-reviewed study of Olaplex found it increased tensile strength 47.6% <InlineReference id="138" />.

That sounds impressive until you realize that A LOT of other cheaper actives have at least some science that shows they can also increase tensile strength like one study showed a coconut-based oil increased tensile strength by 36% <InlineReference id="146" />.

I see many people lamenting they can't afford the more expensive strong bond builders and worrying they are missing out on something truly revolutionary. I'm not sure they are! I really want to see studies testing "bond repair" actives against other conditioners.

Another thing I can't stress enough is that so much of the research is on EXTREMELY damaged hair OR hair that's in the process of being bleached/permed/relaxed. We don't have a ton of info about how well these work as at-home treatments on less damaged hair.

Overall there is just a real shortage of peer-reviewed research on these products especially on curly hair. Peer-review isn't perfect, but it helps us get more of an idea of how and why these products work, which can help us choose the right products for our problems.


## Can you benefit from bonding products if your hair is low porosity (undamaged)
There isn't any research on this so I can only speak to personal experience, which is that I've tried several protein-based "bond repair" products on my short undamaged hair and they really didn't seem to do much. But some people report that these treatments boost their [curls/waves](/hair-types). I'd like to see more study on this. And in the meantime I'm not sure I'd seek out these products with the hope that they'll boost curls/waves in your undamaged hair.

BUT, I did do a test on myself with Curlsmith Bonding Salve. I treated one side of my hair and used a regular mask on the other side. My hair actually did look curlier on the Curlsmith side! You can see a video [of the test on Tik-Tok](https://www.tiktok.com/@curlsbot/video/7578516516686023966).

<BlogProduct
  name="Curlsmith Bond Curl Rehab Salve "

  buyText="Curlsmith (US and UK)"
  amazonLink="https://amzn.to/3RMalQu"
/>

I also tried out the two recommended weak bond repair products. The Garnier Hair Filler treatment didn't seem to do much for my hair ([see the video here](https://www.tiktok.com/@curlsbot/video/7581913022646586654)). I might try it specifically as a hard water treatment at some point.  Garnier Hair Filler contains citric acid, which helps chelate that (remove hard water deposits see my [guide to hard water](/blog/curly-hair-hard-water)).

The Pantene gold line (Miracle Rescue) in general has been beneficial for my hair, even if it doesn't need bond repair. These are just quality products. Panthenol isn't just a "bond repair" ingredient, it also can help soften coarse white hairs that I've gotten with age to make them more manageable.

So I wouldn't specially seek out bond repair for my low porosity hair, but I also wouldn't rule out products just because they are labeled as "bond repair".

## Final Thoughts

The strong systems are the only genuinely new science here, and even those have limits. The weak systems are often just common ingredient rebranded as "bond repair".

The most important thing is not buying all the claims that bond repair products make and viewing bond repair as not something magical, but just another type of conditioning.
