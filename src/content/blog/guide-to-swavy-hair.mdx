Is my hair just straight? Or could it be wavy? If you've ever wondered this, you might have swavy hair.

Let's get this straight (haha), if you had genuinely straight hair, this would not be a question on your mind.

You my friend, have swavy hair. Swavy is one of the most misunderstood hair types. I’ve seen it dismissed as “barely wavy” or “almost straight.”

The truth is your hair IS swavy, it's loose waves. And while it might never be curls, it is surprisingly versatile and beautiful in its own way.

<TableOfContents />

## TL;DR

Swavy hair is NOT straight hair. It is a loose wave hair type. Go for lightweight products and avoid heavy creams and oils. My general formula for a routine is volumizing shampoo, volumizing conditioner, a light leave-in, and a light mousse OR gel.

## What Is Swavy Hair

<BlogImage

In the [CurlsBot type system](/hair-types), **Swavy hair** is hair that:

- Does not naturally dry completely straight with zero bends or waves
- Also does not ever form curls, even occasionally

It is the most elongated type in [our system](/hair-types). Physics-wise, it’s still a coil, just an extremely elongated one. Shrinkage is also a huge part of our system, which is the difference between the length of hair in its dry resting state and its stretched length. For swavy hair, the shrinkage is extremely small.


You’ll sometimes see this texture labeled as “1b” or “1c” on TikTok or modern charts, but those labels are derived from the Walker system. In the original Walker system, _any_ visible wave was type 2, and 1c referred to coarse straight hair that is usually extremely straight and resistant to texture. So those labels don’t really map cleanly onto what people are trying to describe now. There is a hair type system called the Irrizarry system that has a "beach waves" type that is similar to swavy, but this system isn't commonly used. [You can read more in my post on the science and history of hair typing systems.](/blog/the-science-of-hair-typing)

I did not invent the term “swavy” and do not know who did, but I do know the s is there because loose waves often form an s pattern.

## How Do You Know If You Have Swavy Hair

The easiest answer is: take the CurlsBot quiz.

<HairTypeQuizBanner />

But conceptually, it’s simple. CurlsBot curl typing is based on scientific evidence that straight hair is structurally distinct from other textures. You can read more about it in our guide to the science of hair typing.

If your hair:

- Does not dry completely, totally straight
- Has some bends, flips, or soft waves when dried naturally
- Never curls

That’s Swavy.

If your hair is often described as “straight but frizzy” or “straight but poofy,” it may also be Swavy.

## How Swavy Differs From Other Hair Types

<BlogImage

  alt="Illustration of some different swavy hair patterns"

**Compared to straight hair:**
Swavy hair does not dry perfectly straight and is more prone to frizz and puffiness. But on the plus side many straight people struggle to add texture, and adding some texture is a bit easier with swavy hair.

**Compared to wavy hair:**
Wavy hair, in our system, sits closer to curls. It’s mostly waves but may occasionally curl. Swavy never does.

Swavy is usually lumped into categories like “1a–2a,” “2a–2c,” or the LOIS “S” type, which is part of why it gets so muddled.

Hair type is also fluid. If Swavy hair changes types, it is most likely to change to wavy.

I currently have Swavy hair and used to have wavy hair. In my case, the shift was likely driven by hormones, aging, and my haircut.

## How to Care for Swavy Hair

Swavy hair elongates easily. Because it has little to no shrinkage, many curly hair products weigh it down fast, making hair look stringy or greasy.

General care principles:

- Lightweight products work best
- Liquid or spray textures tend to outperform creams
- Volume is easy to lose and harder to get back

Swavy hair is also the curl type most prone to static flyaways, so hair products that are anti-static like many spray leave ins can be genuinely helpful. Especially in the winter.

Detangling dry often works well for Swavy hair. Dry hair is less vulnerable to damage, and this texture usually doesn’t require much force to detangle.

Swavy hair can tolerate traditional dry brushing methods, including boar bristle brushes, which help distribute natural sebum for shine.

Swavy hair is also more likely to look oily and get weighed down, so shampoos that actually cleanse matter. Many curl shampoos and co-washes simply aren’t effective enough.

## Products for Swavy Hair

There’s usually no reason for Swavy hair to use curl shampoos or conditioners. They’re often too heavy and not cleansing enough.

What _does_ tend to work:

- Volumizing or fullness shampoos
- Lightweight conditioners or glosses
- Light gels and mousses

<NewsletterSignup />

Swavy hair can also benefit from products that are often avoided by curlier textures, like hairspray. Many curlies find these drying, but they can be excellent for adding hold and body without weight on swavy hair.

Creamy and oily products are the most common problem category. Many are simply too dense and over-conditioning. I see so many people with this hair type grabbing a curl cream and regretting it.

### Products to use with caution

The biggest problem products I see for swavy hair are

- Oils
- Creams
- Deep conditioners

I see a lot of people say that deep conditioners are just conditioners, which is true, but for curly brands they often have tons of oils and butters. These can build up on swavy hair and weigh it down. If you want a deep conditioner choose a light one like this one OR do a heavier deep conditioning mask as a pre-shampoo treatment.

  ]}
/>
Creams are a go-to product for regular curls, but for swavy hair they are optional and sometimes detrimental because they have so many conditioners. If you do want to use one, go for one that's specifically formulated to be light. And go light on the application.

Oils are often just too heavy and at their worst can be really really hard to get out. I learned the hard way with coconut oil. Oils are unnecessary but can be helpful for high porosity/damaged ends, so if you want to use them switch them to pre-poo like Abbey Yung does. If you want to use them post-wash, opt for a blend specifically formulated to be lightweight instead of just plain kitchen oil-- and use sparingly.

### Signs you have the wrong products

Swavy hair is very prone to **overconditioning**, which is when hair feels limp, mushy, and often has a weaker wave or curl pattern.

Some people mistake this for "moisture overload," but it has more to do with conditioners than it does with moisture. It happens when too many heavy conditioning products weigh your hair strands down, turning them mushy or stringy.

The solution? Clarify and lighter products!

## Subtypes of Swavy Hair

Not all swavy hair is the same! Hair type is just one factor that can influence how your hair behaves. There are other factors that can influence how your hair behaves such as:


<HairTypeFactors />
- **Strand width**

  - **Fine** (small strand width) swavy hair is prone to static flyaways and low volume, so benefits from anti-static products and texture-adding products
  - **Coarse** (large strand width) swavy hair is less static-prone but can have more stubborn frizz, where pre-shampoo masks can help soften resistant areas

- **Density**

  - **Thin** (low density) swavy hair looks greasy very easily
  - **Thick** (high density) swavy hair may tolerate slightly richer products, but still not heavy ones

- **Porosity**
  - Swavy hair can be any porosity
  - [**High porosity**](/porosity/high-porosity) Swavy hair is tricky because damage is often mistaken for a need for heavy products, check out our light products guide for product recs
  - Lightweight formulas with cationic ingredients that bind to damaged areas work better than rich creams for **high porosity** swavy hair

Most people have a mix of all of the above. I have fine _and_ coarse strands, thin _and_ thick areas, higher-porosity ends, and lower-porosity roots.

That’s normal. [If you're curious about your porosity take our porosity quiz](/porosity-quiz/).

## Products to look for

You have two major types of products to look for

- Smoothing/glossing
- Volume/fullness

I don't usually mix these in a routine. I go for products labeled smoothing or glossing if I'm wearing in loose waves OR for products labeled volume or fullness if I want to look more wavy. But I've occasionally had success mixing them up. Just be aware the smoothing product will make your hair look straighter and volume products will likely make your hair look more wavy.

## A Basic Routine for Swavy Hair

### Clarifying shampoo

Weekly to bi-weekly clarifying is usually a good idea.

### Gentle shampoo (optional)

For non-clarifying washes. It's fine to use a clarifying shampoo every wash if you want to, but many people find it a bit drying.

</BlogProductGrid>

### Conditioner or gloss (optional)

Some people with swavy hair really don't need much conditioning. They can pick a really light rinse out or use a gloss instead as [Abbey Yung recommends](/blog/the-abbey-yung-method) or a leave-in as a rinse off as [Wavyhairroutines talks about](https://www.tiktok.com/@wavyhairroutinesofficial/video/7566253682182982943). If you skip rinse-out conditioning, I strongly recommend a leave-in for protection against friction and UV damage.

### Leave-in

For protection against heat, UV, and pollution, I now consider this non-optional. Light spray leave-ins work best.

Abbey Yung’s routine is pretty close to ideal for Swavy hair, which makes me suspect this may be her natural texture. If you want to learn her method check out our [Abbey Yung Method Guide](/blog/the-abbey-yung-method).

## Hairstyling Products

This is very much a choose-your-own-adventure situation. You can wear your hair as smooth undulating subtle waves or bulk up the waviness for textured beach waves.

### My soft and smooth routine

I go for an "anti frizz serum" type product like Color Wow Dream Coat. Use the curl version if you don’t use much heat. [Hover diffuse](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7EpU5cVqsjI) on low to dry, pointing the dryer down so frizz doesn't form.

This product usually helps my hair be frizz-free for 1-3 days. It's nice to just wake up and not have to do anything to my hair. Sometimes I will layer a gel like MopTop Anti-Frizz for extra hold. I have a video of me using it [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/DQmu3WVgS__/).

### My air-dry cream routine

Air dry creams are the latest trend and many are formulated to be light. I have used the Kitsch one and it works pretty well, though it doesn't have much hold. I end up with subtle waves and some halo frizz, but overall a nice smooth look. I have a video of me using it [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/DQzSd5VEe8l/).

### **Beach waves:**

This is my go to routine most days. I use a gel or mousse on very wet hair, brush it with a denman, scrunch it, [pixie diffuse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KAw2cLVUA) for 10 minutes, and air dry the rest of the way. This gives me some nice waves even though they usually relax out by the second day. [Here's a video of me using Miche Set](https://www.tiktok.com/@curlsbot/video/7561199178387295519) and [here's a video of me using two gels](https://www.tiktok.com/@curlsbot/video/7561072568615128350).

## Brushed Out

This is what I usually do for second day hair.
Brushing can make your hair poofy, but to minimize this I use a spray leave in or other anti friction product. Adding a very lightweight "oil" product also helps. I use a traditional boar bristle brush.

### A texture and volume routine

Texturizing products that add what Barbie Delle calls “grit.” Ingredients that do this include magnesium sulfate, rice water, and protein-based products.

Unfortunately I am a weirdo and I hate the texture of these products, so I can't provide much advice but there are lots of great videos out there and Abbey Yung also recommends some texturizing products.

## Drying Swavy Hair

Ah the age old debate of air dry vs. blow dry. I settled this for myself by just doing both!

Since swavy hair is easily elongated, air drying will often make it more elongated, because water is heavy and your hair is just sitting there with water in it while it dries.

Because of that I opt to diffuse at least some of the way. I've found the [pixie diffuse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KAw2cLVUA) method gives me the best waves. Even 5-10 minutes helps build my waves up A LOT.

OFC you can also do a traditional blow out but don't forget a heat protectant!

Volume at the roots can be hard to get with swavy hair, I use [root clipping](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/QnBBuO4CFYo) most days. Focusing diffusing on the roots with the clips in helps a lot.

## Styling Swavy Hair

Swavy hair is extremely versatile.

- It blow-dries straight easily
- It holds curling iron styles well
- Heatless curls tend to work especially well

Elongation is not a flaw. Swavy hair often looks great worn shiny and subtly wavy using boar bristle brushing or very lightweight smoothing serums.

Glossing and smoothing trends usually work well for this texture, even though they also further elongate the pattern.

Personally I love [brush styling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79t4iKNnXO8) for swavy hair. It makes my pattern more consistent and defined. I will say it takes a bit of practice to get the hang of it. It really helps to watch some tutorials like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79t4iKNnXO8).

## Refreshing Swavy Hair

Swavy hair refreshes in multiple ways:

- **Wet refresh:** rewet, scrunch, diffuse
- **Dry refresh:** use an anhydrous product like a serum, oil, or pomade, often with brushing
- **Mixed refresh:** lightly rewet with a water-based product like mousse

For me the wet and mixed refreshes are almost never good though, and I opt for a dry refresh or brushing out.

Heatless curls are also an excellent refresh option. If my second-day hair looks questionable, overnight heatless curls usually fix it completely.

## Haircuts for Swavy Hair

In my opinion, people with this hair type will not get very good results from "curly cuts" like the deva or ouidad cuts...and I know this from experience.

My stylist who does rezo and ouidad cuts told me not to bother and just go for a traditional cut. Which has honestly saved me a lot of money and frustration.

I do like cuts with a lot of layers like wolf cuts.

## The Science of Swavy Hair

A few relevant points from the research:

- Looser textures show more pattern variability
- L’Oréal’s system includes a type 2 that is not straight but not very wavy, which likely maps well to Swavy
- From a physics perspective, Swavy hair behaves like an extremely elongated coil
- The **conditioning trade-off curve** for Swavy hair is very low, meaning it’s easy to lose volume with excess conditioning

You can read more about this in our posts about our [curl type system](/blog/curlsbot-curl-typing) and [the science and history of hair typing](/blog/the-science-of-hair-typing).

## Influencers with swavy hair

I could only find two people who claim to have this hair type: Matcha Maddie([Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/UxzPPNMl2Eo), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/matchamaddie/), and [Tik-Tok](https://www.tiktok.com/@matchamaddie)) and [SwavyCurlyCourtney](https://swavycurlycourtney.com/). Though Courtney veers more towards the wavy hair type, her tips will generally work for people with swavy hair.

An influencer who hasn't said she has this type, but looks like she might is jadeswayves. I think her tips are going to be especially useful for longer swavy hair.

It's actually somewhat hard to find influencers with this hair type, because a lot of people just use heat on it. Also the CurlsBot type system is based on how hair behaves so it's hard to tell just by looks.

[Email me if you'd like to be listed!](/contact) [I also made a Pinterest Board of influencers who either might have swavy hair OR have tips useful for the type](https://www.pinterest.com/curlsbot/swavy-hair-influencers/).
