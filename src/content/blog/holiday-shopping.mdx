In this guide I'll feature picks from our most popular posts. If you read about these products, you can get them at a discount this holiday season. Most of these sales should last from now until the New Year but a few are only until Cyber Monday.

And MANY of these products are available on [Curls Monthly, a monthly subscription service that lets you try a bunch of products to see if they work for you](https://curlsmonthly.com/?ref=curlsbot)! They are doing a black friday sale offering a [special yearly subscription with bonus products and coaching](https://curlsmonthly.com/?ref=curlsbot).

In the EU? Check out the Curlsmith and Tootilab products below. Australia, we saw [Lohy](https://lohy.com.au?aff=49) has a sale as well!

## Strong Bond Repair Products
Featured in both the [Abbey Yung Method Guide](/blog/the-abbey-yung-method) and [The Skeptics Guide to Bond Repair for Curly/Wavy Hair](/blog/skeptics-guide-bond-repair) posts, these are the only four producs in the world that claim to repair strong, covalent bonds. They are normally very expensive that's why they are the top picks for this post.

## My personal picks
These are what I picked up at recent sales

<BlogProduct
  name="Eva Mane Magic"
  subtitle="One of the spray leave-ins I recommend that works awesome on all curl types but especially finer, low porosity, and wavy hair. On sale both on Eva NYC and Amazon."

- [Color Wow Dream Coat for Curly Hair @ Amazon](https://amzn.to/4is9qBk): I've only tried this once so far but it was really lightweight and helped prevent frizz really well, while taking MUCH less time to dry than my usual products like gel or mousse.
- [Curl Wow Flo-etry @ Amazon](https://amzn.to/48oISw2): If you are looking for a lightweight cream, this is it. It is specially formulated not to weigh down hair.
- [Miche Set Gel to Foam](https://www.michebeauty.com/collections/stylers/products/set-curl-defining-mousse?rfsn=8688386.3de231): I tested over 10 mousses this year and this was my favorite. It works for nearly all curl types.
- [Tootilab Gel](https://collabs.shop/cebjoi): I tried this on [Curls Monthly](https://curlsmonthly.com/?ref=curlsbot) and really liked it so I bought a full size for myself on their black friday sale.
