If you‚Äôve stumbled across ‚ÄúThe Worst Curly Hair Routine on the Internet,‚Äù you‚Äôre probably wondering what it actually is ‚Äî and whether anyone should try it. The routine comes from hair influencer Anna Primavera, who shared it on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DF_YiRsp1uT/?hl=en) and [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@aannaprimaveraa/video/7470672141445303582).

Since her videos move fast, I‚Äôve broken down each step here (with links to the products) so you can see exactly what it involves.

This is an ideal routine for [high](/porosity/high-porosity)  or [mixed](/porosity/mixed-porosity) porosity hair that's wavy or has loose curls.

<TableOfContents />

## Why is it the "Worst" ?

Anna calls it the ‚Äúworst‚Äù routine because it breaks several curly hair ‚Äúrules‚Äù, especially those popularized by the [Curly Girl Method](/curly-girl-method). For example:

* **Dry brushing** before washing is often framed as one of the worst things you can do for curls.
* **Flipping and diffuse scrunching** are usually labeled as frizz-causing no-nos.
* **Skipping leave-ins/creams** also goes against the grain. (Though honestly, the heat protectant she uses basically *is* a lightweight leave-in. I often recommend spray leave-ins that double as heat protectants for people who find creams too heavy.)

On top of that, Anna‚Äôs routine includes products that are *not* [Curly Girl Method](/curly-girl-method)‚Äìapproved, especially the heat protectant, which contains multiple [silicones](/groups/silicones). You *could* try a CGM-friendly alternative, but the truth is that silicones remain uniquely effective for heat protection and shine. [Check out our guide to help you decide if you need CGM or not](/blog/the-curly-girl-method-guide).


## Should you use the "Worst Curly Hair Routine on the Internet"?

**TL;DR:** Best for wavy or loose curls with mixed-to-high porosity.

Anna says this routine delivers volume and bounce that lasts for days. I‚Äôd agree, but it‚Äôs not for everyone.

* **Best for wavy/loose curls:** Dry brushing is less damaging for [looser patterns since less force is needed to get the brush through the hair](/blog/curly-vs-wavy-hair). (If you struggle to get a brush through your hair, try a special detangling brush or try with a detangler spray to reduce tension.)
* **Porosity matters:** Anna‚Äôs hair seems wavy-to-loose curly, long, and color-treated ‚Äî all signs of mixed/high porosity. That hair type needs protection but gets weighed down easily.
* **How this routine works for her:** She balances heavy and light products, leaning on strong-hold stylers. The silicone-rich heat protectant is especially good for protecting high-porosity hair from hazards like heat and brushing.
* **If you have low porosity:** You might want to swap the mask for a regular conditioner to avoid weighing down your hair.

## Can you do the "Worst Curly Hair Routine on the Internet" while following CGM?

Yes ‚Äî but you‚Äôll be missing out on the biggest strength of this routine: [**silicones.**](/groups/silicones)

[Silicones](/groups/silicones) are uniquely effective for high-porosity hair. They:
- Provide superior heat protection compared to other ingredients
- Smooth the cuticle to make it easier to manage and shinier
- Add a layer of general protection without heavy buildup for most people
- Protect from friction (like brushing)

You *could* swap in [CGM](/curly-girl-method)-approved alternatives, but they likely won‚Äôt offer quite the same level of protection or performance.

## The Worst Curly Hair Routine on the Internet (Step by Step)

1. **Dry brush** to detangle (use a detangler if needed).
2. In the shower, **shampoo twice**.
3. Use a **hair mask instead of conditioner**.
4. After showering, apply **4 pumps of mousse**. Flip hair forward, smooth from roots to ends, then scrunch.
5. Apply a **tiny amount of gel**. Flip hair forward, smooth root to ends, then scrunch.
6. Put **heat protectant on your hands** and scrunch it in.
7. **Diffuse** on medium heat/medium speed, actively scrunching with the diffuser.
8. When hair is ~60% dry, **repeat gel step**. Then flip side to side and glaze a little over the top layer to smooth frizz.
9. Continue **diffusing until fully dry**.

## My Review of The Worst Curly Hair Routine on the Internet

I have wavy, low-porosity hair and tried this routine back when my hair was long. The results? Tons of volume ‚Äî but also a bit on the *poofy* side. To be fair, I was using a cheap travel dryer at the time, which probably created more frizz than the Dyson Anna uses.

<BlogImage

  alt="A before and after of my hair when I tried the routine"
  caption="My hair looked kind of poofy when I tried the routine"
  float="right"
/>

The Dyson is known for minimizing frizz compared to regular dryers, so it might be a key part of why this routine works for her. I‚Äôve since upgraded to a slightly better dryer, so I may give the routine another shot and see if the results improve.

I personally wouldn't use a mask as a conditioner, I think because my hair is low porosity it just weighs it down.

Another thing is if you want even heat protection, just scrunching it in is likely not enough. I would recommend sectioning and spraying an even coat on each section.


## Other Products You Can Use

Want to try this routine with what you already have at home? Here‚Äôs how to adapt it:

- **Shampoo:** Look for one formulated for damaged hair with moderate cleansing power.
- **Mask/Conditioner:** Use a mask that works as a regular conditioner (not a once-in-a-while treatment). Ideally low- or no-protein and not too heavy (like I'd avoid Shea Moisture masks).
- **Mousse:** Choose a mousse made for curly hair, as it has lightweight conditioning, like the Rizos Lightweight Mousse.
- **Gel:** Go for a hard-hold gel that feels light in the hair.
- **Heat Protectant:** Any good heat protectant works, but silicones will give the best protection and shine.

## Why The Worst Curly Hair Routine Is Good for the Curl Community

I‚Äôm glad this routine has caught people‚Äôs attention, because it proves an important point: there isn‚Äôt just *one* way to care for curly hair. Just as curl patterns vary, so do the routines that work best for them.

Traditional methods often overlook wavy and looser curl types, which need different approaches. That‚Äôs why I wanted to break down Anna‚Äôs routine here, and why I get so many questions about alternative routines for hair like mine. The more we share routines that actually reflect our diversity of textures, the more helpful the curly community becomes for everyone.
