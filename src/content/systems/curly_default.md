# Default Curly Hair Analysis System

This system provides a balanced approach to analyzing hair product ingredients for curly hair. It's designed to help you find products that:

- Maintain adequate moisture
- Preserve your hair's natural oils
- Provide gentle cleansing
- Balance protein content

## Understanding the Rules

### Sulfates

While not all sulfates are harmful, harsh sulfates like Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) can strip your hair's natural oils. The system flags these ingredients but allows gentler cleansing agents.

### Moisturizing Ingredients

The system looks for beneficial moisturizing ingredients like:

- Glycerin
- Aloe Vera
- Natural oils (Jojoba, Argan, etc.)
- Plant butters (Shea, Cocoa)

### Protein Balance

Protein is important for hair strength, but too much can cause problems. The system helps identify:

- Protein sources in ingredients
- Potential protein overload
- Balance between moisture and protein

### Alcohols

Not all alcohols are bad! The system distinguishes between:

- Volatile alcohols (to avoid)
- Fatty alcohols (generally good)
- Emulsifying alcohols (usually okay)

### Silicones

The system categorizes silicones based on:

- Water solubility
- Build-up potential
- Ease of removal

## When to Use This System

This is a good default choice if you:

- Are new to ingredient analysis
- Have typical curly hair concerns
- Want a balanced approach
- Aren't sure which system to choose
